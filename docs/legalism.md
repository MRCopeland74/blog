##Getting out of the Court Room: the Antidote to Legalism

We live in the time of the blessing and curse of John Calvin’s prominent substitutionary atonement where the only understanding we seem to have of salvation is with a court room analogy. Jesus took our place and so now we are not guilty. 

But let’s talk about this judgment day.

Judgement Day is linked to the jewish festival of Rosh Hashanah. This festival is a celebration. Justice is the word mishpat in Hebrew which we have so egregiously misinterpreted. Many only understand justice under the sense of things being made fair. People getting punished for doing wrong. But this is so incomplete. Justice has always been about restoring order, and making things right. Yes punishment is often a part of this. But so is mercy and compassion. God did not destroy the evil assyrians who deserved to be punished because he saw potential in them. He said I believe these people can still do good in this world. But sometimes God does punish. It’s a balance. Many parents recognize the complexity behind it when raising children. However, in Exodus 34, God gives us the ratio 1000:3 compassion to punishment. His judgements are rooted in mercy. Judgement day is about making things right.

Believe it or not but this is demonstrated in the first 3 verses of the bible. Elohim the word for God is connected to God being judge. Then we had a formless and void and dark world. This represents chaos. The God said let there be light and began to bring order to chaos. He began making things right. We then brought chaos to order in Genesis 3 and so God has spent the rest of the bible and human history working with us to bring chaos back to order.

With this backdrop 
Let’s talk about two groups of people in second temple Judaism. 

Pharisees: spoke about last week putting fences around the law so to not break them this is tremendous zeal. This is your psalm 119 love your law idea. 
Issue not what goes in that defines you but what comes out. Talk about actors. 

Herodians: subscribe to Judaism but are too absorbed in the pleasures and entertainment of this world. But are able to adapt and interact with culture. 

Often as new Christians we end up doing one of two things:
Either get on this weird cycle where we act like Pharisees we love the law so much. Our zeal encourages us to obey every law. We want to do everything possible to make sure we have followed all his commands. Why? Because that’s what real Christians do right. They take God’s commands seriously. 

Then we get to this point where we realize we are trying to earn our salvation. We realize that we just can’t obey all these commands. We start to feel distant from God. So we read Ephesians 2:8 and similar. We determine that we need to stop doing works to please God. 

Therefore, we stop being legalistic and start living in the freedom of Gods victory except with one caveat. We hated our striving for obedience to God’s law that we abandon any law. Our lives look no different than the world. We give in to antinomianism. 

Then what happens? We end up falling into sin so far that we determine that this is not Christianity. We wonder if we have lost our salvation again and guess what we change back into the cycle of legalism. We read James two and all these commands in the New Testament and determine we aren’t Christians unless we do these things. 

This cycle continues as we fluctuate between Pharisees and herodians. Each time it gets more subtle and until like too many Christians in America we fall into the negative of the Pharisees and negative of herodians. People who act like we love God and do Christian things but we love the world and are consumed by its pleasures. But the main symptom of this is how do I know if I am saved? How do I know that God sees me as good enough?

The other option is we mentally backfile all the seemingly contradictory or complicated scripture and go on with our lives that God saved us. This generally results in a lack of zeal and can often result in looking like herodians. We end up compartmentilizing the Gospel and God’s word and could live contradictory lives. Again the fear is that we look like the bad part of the pharisees and the bad part of the herodians.

Let us take a quick deviation. Just before passover every year Pilot recognizing that at Passover most Jews would be in Jerusalem and that it is remembering an event that overthrew the Egyptians, decided that he would go to Jerusalem as well except with an army ready to suppress the Jews. He would ride a white stallion which symbolizes military conquest with an army of soldiers. He would instill fear as the Romans would continue to oppress the Jews. At the same time, Jesus rides in on a donkey with his disciples pronouncing favor and peace. Jesus came to announce his kingdom at the same time pilot was announcing his. This is crazy. And the people wave palm branches symbolizing a revolution. They know exactly what Jesus is doing. Everyone has noticed … or do they? The next thing Jesus does is cry. Wait what? Why? Well, the Jews had completely missed Jesus’ whole mission. They wanted the wrong kingdom. They wanted revenge on the Romans. Hosanna means Lord, Save us. Jesus did come to save them. But Jesus came to die. This is how he saved us and this is how he wants us to do?

You see that entire cycle is completely consumed with self. All it cared about is its own salvation. Did Jesus not do the complete opposite on the cross. He could have saved himself but instead he gave up his life for us. He tells us to take up our cross and follow him Matthew 10:38. Paul says he wishes he could die for others to be saved. Romans 9:1-3. 

Here is the question. What kingdom do you want?

Let’s go back to this day of judgment. Remember purpose is not only to bring retributive justice on the evil people. This is the kingdom that the jews want and sadly this is what substutionary atonement is overly consumed with. We must be punished for wrong doing. But this is not true. 1000:3. This is the day that Jesus returns to make everything right. To bring order to chaos. But that is done by bringing Gods kingdom. This kingdom is about self sacrifice. This is what it looks like for the world to be made right. It is this upside down kingdom. It is this sacrificial love. It is about giving up ourselves for others not us focusing on what saves us. 

So this is where we get out the court room. We stop focusing on how to get saved and we start focusing on how to save others.  There is personal salvation, which we all have for accepting Jesus. But now we leave the court room. The verdict is in. We are justified. But I really want you to broaden your understanding of salvation. There is also global salvation. This should be where our focus should be. Salvation is not just about accepting Jesus as Lord it is about bringing chaos to order. Bringing God’s Kingdom to earth.

There is one more thing I want to talk about which is essential. It is this idea of Sabbath. It is that weird commandment in the 10 commandments that we do not understand how it links to today’s world. Sometime I will talk to you about the 10 commandments. Sabbath is more than about rest. It is also about Honoring God. We rest to show that we trust God has control. Sabbath is about letting go. Sabbath is letting the good works you have done be good works. If we don’t do that and keep adding to them, they never become good works because they can never establish relationship. This is complex but important as it is essential to dethroning legalism and fear. Sabbath is saying that what I have done this week is good and now I trust God that he will use it. If we never stop to rest we are not trusting God, we are not giving up control. We are not telling the truth about God that he created this universe and is in control. 

Ultimately, if we do not stop trying to save ourselves and be a perfect christian by doing all these good works, we rob ourselves of this trusting relationship with God. And look at that if we don’t sabbath, we are making it about ourselves again. We are playing God. We are trying to save ourselves. God has called us to trust in him and focus on others.

So get out of the court room, be a living sacrifice for others good and God’s kingdom, and rest in the fact that God is in control and that he is using our good works for his kingdom. Remember his judgements are rooted in mercy.
