##What is Love: fundamentals to Christianity

Love is the most fundamental thing to understand as a christian or as any person. Love is the true definition of purpose although in later blogs we will talk about how that purpose looks slightly more practically. This blog will define love. 

Now if you have not read the previous blog on truth, you should do that first as it explains how we know something is true and gives the context to love. Love is the backbone to all morality. What we will be doing today is looking at the laws God gives to determine how to love. Therefore, the best place to start is in genesis. Now if we start with the prolog to the Abraham story, we have several incredible stories about how God sets up this universe. Since this is not an in depth study of genesis, I will be pointing out the major points (and sometimes the link or evidence might not be so clear. I will go through these stories in more depth at a later point). 

In Genesis 1:1-3, we already see God’s intention with the world. The word Elohim meaning God has the connotation of a judge. Now, in Hebrew, the point of a judge is to restore things to order. This has two sides, punishment/destruction or forgiveness and mercy. Either way the goal is restoration. God never does something outside of the intention of restoration. This is exactly what we see God do in these verses. The universe is chaotic nothingness and God then says let there be light. This is the first step in restoring order. He then spends the rest of genesis one bring order to the chaos. Then in Genesis 3 we sin and bring chaos back into the world. The rest of the bible is God revealing his plan on how he is bringing order back to this world. The difference is, we are involved with it and it is our job to do our part in bringing order to chaos in this world. 

Okay so far we know that our purpose has to do with bringing order to chaos. Therefore, love has to do the same thing. If what you do does not bring order to this world, it is not love but if what you do does bring order to this world, then it is love. Okay, but how do we know if something brings order? Well that is what the bible will help us understand. Next stop the tower of babel. 

The tower of babel has become one of my favorite stories once I finally understood what it was saying. It is way more complicated than what I will explain here and it is interlinked with the Noah story and the garden of eden story. The links are fascinating and brilliant but for another time. The main point of the tower of babel story lies in the line, we will make a name for ourselves. This statement is beautifully juxtaposed to the beginning of the Abraham story. Abraham chooses Sarah knowing she is barren. Therefore, he sacrifices his own chance to have children and a heritage in order to restore honor to Sarah’s father and show compassion on Sarah. This is a huge commitment and one that certainly does not benefit Abrahams name. Does that ring a bell? You see the reason God chose Abraham while he ended the plans of the people trying to build a giant tower is because of whose name they were doing it for. The tower of babel did it for their own name while Abraham did it for someone else name. Okay, so we are making progress. The first definition of restoring order is when we make someone else’s name great and not ours. We are willing to sacrifice our own name for success of someone else. 

There is a lot in genesis about what making someone else’s name great looks like but we will skip most of it for the sake of brevity but two things worth paying attention too are: how important hospitality is and reconciliation between broken relationships. The hospitality we see in Abraham, Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah, and Rebekah. The reconciliation we see between Jacob and Esau, Rachel and Leah, and Joseph and his brothers. 

Moving to exodus. We are introduced to the law but particularly the 10 commandments. These seemingly simple commandments are so much richer than most think. First let’s list the commandments.

1. I am the Lord your God
2. You shall have no other gods before me, you shall not make an idol for yourself
3. You shall not take the Lord’s name in vain.
4. You shall keep the sabbath holy
5. Honor your mother and father
6. Do not murder
7. Do not commit adultery
8. Do not steal
9. Do not bear false witness
10. Do not covet anyone’s possessions

Now we know that the 10 commandments had two tablets. Therefore the first thing you think about is there must be link between the first half and the second half. You would be right. Now if we look at the first five and the second five, what is common to each side. What we see is the first five are the relationship between you and your creators and the second five is the relationship between you and your peers or everyone else. Now what is the link?


|Creator Command|	Peer Command	|Link|
|------------------|-------------|-------------|
|I am the Lord your God|	Do not murder|	Do not do away with others. |
|You shall have no other gods before me, you shall not make an idol for yourself|	Do not commit adultery|	Do not betray relationships.|
|You shall not take the Lord’s name in vain.|	Do not steal	|Do not sabotage someone’s dignity.|
|You shall keep the sabbath holy	|Do not bear false witness	|Do not sabotage someone’s reputation.|
|Honor your mother and father|	Do not covet anyone’s possessions	|Do not violate your own life.|


Let’s talk more about these links. Why would you want to murder someone. It would be because you do not want them in your life. Another way you can do that is by ignoring them. And that is exactly what we do with God. Jesus took this further and said if you’re angry you have committed murder. We can see that the first thing you want when you are angry at someone is for them to no longer exist or be out of your life. 

Now what happens when your commit adultery? You betray a relationship. That is exactly what you do when you put idols before God. Jesus says if you look at someone in lust, you have committed adultery. It is easy to see how you have betrayed that relationship in your heart as you are putting someone else ahead of a more important relationship. Lust always has the meaning of exploiting something or someone for your own pleasure. When it comes to sexuality, it looks like adultery. Notice, the betrayal of a relationship doesn’t start with the goal to spite or betray the original relationship but rather a selfish desire pleasure yourself. However, as usual when we put ourselves ahead of others especially in a lustful manner, others often get hurt. 

What about God’s name and stealing. One thing to note is that the word in the Torah used for steal suggests kidnapping. When we steal we violate someone’s dignity. We do not care about their worth or who they are. Taking God’s name in vain is the same thing. We are taking what God has and we are tarnishing it. Each person has inherent not based on what we do. When we take advantage of someone because we think they are less than or don’t deserve what they have for our own selfish gain, we violate their own God given value. 

With regards to sabbath and lying, we change from violating inherent value to reputation. We are discarding what the actions of that person or even sabotaging them. When God created the world he rested at the end. Therefore as an ode to Hod we rest as well to acknowledge he is our creator and has ultimate control. The Jews also remember the sabbath as a remembrance for how God brought them out of Egypt. Both these acts acknowledge what God did. When we violate sabbath, we are lying about what God has done. We should instead be celebrating the good works of others and not seeking to lie for own personal gain. But furthermore if someone else has done something bad we should not lie about it for personal gain. The truth wins out and must be made known. 

The last relationship is about being content with who you are. We need to recognize that our parents gave us life and should honor them for it. If we spite them for that we violate ourselves as we undermine our own existence. It’s the same with coveting. It’s this idea that you want to be someone else. We need to recognize that God has given us value and he loves us. He knitted us together in our mothers womb and has a purpose for our lives. 

Now we get to the third layer. We can see how each relationship has to do with violation. We start with violation of their physical existence. We then have a violation of relationships. Next is a violation of inherent value. Followed by a violation of action. This results in a total violation of self. Which is why the final violation is a recognition that if someone else cannot be violate then I should not be violated either. 

Rabbi Hillel was asked how would you sum up the Torah. His response was don’t do to others what you would despise. It is easy to see as we went through the Ten Commandments exactly what Hillel was saying. What we can also see is that these commandments are more about respect than love. This is because we can’t love unless we first respect the person. Love is the creation of a union but if this union is not based on respect then it will turn into abuse. 

This is why Jesus took Hillel’s comment further and turned it positive. Do to others as you would like to be treated. What we see from Jesus is more of an emphasis to create relationships. He definitely still emphasizes respect but is encouraging a complete union of people. 

Which leads us to the most important commandments: love God with everything and love others as yourself. The as yourself is the interesting add on here. You see how since this statement is based on respect which is a reference to the Ten Commandments, we need to respect ourselves in fact love ourselves before we can love others. This means love starts with individuals and slowly combines with others to create communities until we are one in mind and goal. This is an obvious call back to the Tower of Babel where there the people were one in mind and goal. The difference is the goal won’t be to  make their own name great but rather God’s name great. This is what the Jews refer to as the messianic age, what Jesus calls the kingdom of grace and what we call the new heavens and new earth. 

However, there is one element missing to love. It is the idea that love is linked to purpose. We see God map out our purpose in Genesis one and two that we should. (We will map out this in more detail in a later blog). These purposes are about imitating God in creating and relationships. Since love is about creating a union in order to execute Gods purpose for us, love needs to be about technological advancement, human propagation as well as a union in mind and goal with respect. All this to glorify God.
