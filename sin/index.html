                <h2 id="sin">Sin</h2>
<p>There are many misconceptions about sin throughout the world and even within the christian faith. Many people view sin in a static sense where there are a list of dos and don'ts (especially don'ts) that need to be followed otherwise we sin. This I would argue is very inaccurate. The most accurate defenition based on how the israelites used it was to miss the mark. We can imagine an archer shooting at the target and if he does not get bullseye, then he missed the market and in some sense sinned. Now, many people know that but not many see the gravity of that statement. We think that well to miss the mark would be the same as not following one of those dos or don'ts. That I think misses out on what missing the mark truly is. Many people have philosophized what the perfect human might be and how do you get there. Christains argue that that person existed and his name is Jesus. Would it not be more appropriate to say that to miss the mark would be to do anything that inhibits us from looking like Jesus or that perfect person. This to me is a far better way we can contextulize sin. Is what we are doing preventing us from being the best possible person. Then to become better at that would be sanctification. Now there are a couple of things to discuss here that need to be fleshed out further. First, what does a perfect person look like. Second, how do rules in the bible relate to helping us to become that especially at different levels of maturity. Thirdly, are their derivative sins of higher order and how do we handle those situations.</p>
<p>Many chirstians recognize that Jesus was the perfect person but from the way they red the bible the think Jesus was simply a rule following scripture knowing hpyer compassionate and caring person. Although, none of this is wrong, it is very incomplete. I have watched many pastors or highly religious christain parents raise there kids exactly like I defined above. But so often these kids end up angry or resentful at christianity. Many of these kids are weak and easily stepped on and have a very narrow worldview. Let us go through some of what the bible defines as a perfect person and look at how Jesus mirrored it. The way the bible is set up is that Genesis 1-12 is the building block and stage setter for everything else that comes in the bible and it is difficult to find a theme in the bible that is not ultimately rooted in the first 12 chapters. The first chapter teaches us about the fact that we cannot control everything and that rest is a good thing and that being productive and using the skills we were given is a good thing. the second chapter teaches us to enjoy the world we are given but be thankful. It also teaches us that relationships are paramount and that vulnerability and generosity is a key to the joy of the relationship. The third chapter teaches us that we do not get to choose how the world works and what we think is right or wrong rather these things are already in place. Our desires are not good thermometers for morality. It also expounds on how when we choose our desires over true good given by God, it results in our own corruption and objectification of others indicating that God's way of setting up the world is the objective true and best way. Chapter 4 talks about the imporantance of sacrifice and the consequences of an insufficient sacrifice. It points to the necessity of adventure and failure and how to get out of our comfort zone to grow. It teaches about forgiving yourself and having the humility to recognize we can do better. It also teaches that if we are not willing to take risks we will never grow into great people and that rather that those who do not tke risks will become resentful and will seek to cause pain, suffering and death to the innocent. In chapter 6 we are taught to always be prepared for the suffering and hard times and that these things are a fact of life. It teaches about having a plan for the future and having faith that sacrificing instant gratification can result in us not getting destroyed by the inevitable calamities in this world. It also teaches about having patience. Chapter 7 and 8 teaches us that like in chapter 1 that we should give up trying to control everything. Chapter 1 is about trying to control over creating everything good while chapter 7 and 8 is about trying to control destroying everything that is bad. There are limits on these things. We are taught to have mercy. We are taught not try and control everything people do as that is objectification. Rather we should trust in each other even if people cannot do things as well as we can or do not want to do things the way we want. Chapter 9 teaches us about boundaires. Too much vulnerability to some people can be destructive. It further teaches about mercy and how to not let our anger go too far. It teaches that instead we should forgive. The first half Chapter 11 teaches about not being selfish and the second half teaches us to be selfless  to make other peoples name great not ours. It teaches us to bring these good traits we have spoken about to earth and to others and not to run away and create a pseudo utopia in which we think everything will be perfect under our rationlization. Finally, in chapter 12 with all these ideas in mind God calls us out into adventure. He calls us away from the safety of our own comforts and towards the unknown asking us to have faith that going through a difficult period and taking risks will make us better. </p>
<p>What we see from this is not a picture of rules to follow but rather about molding ourselves into a competent mature interconnected individual that can take on the world and anything that is thrown at them while still caring about other people making their name great and not objectifying them. As I look at Jesus' Story more closely this is exactly what I see. Jesus undertook an adventure away from his familiy and despite what the world threw at him he was prepared and cared for others in the process. He never manipulated or used someone for his persnal gain and was prepared to sacrifice for others all the time. He never blamed anyone instead he forgave and took the burden of their (and our) sin on him. This is true sacrifice. It genuinely cost him something when he sacrificed and that was not just on the cross. This is in contrast to Cain and in line with Abel in Genesis 4. These are the charactersitics of a perfect person and this is the type of person we should be aspiring to be. To sin would be live in a way that would go against becoming this person.</p>
<p>Now, we look to the second question. Why are there so many rules in the bible. Are we not supposed to follow all of them? Were the Jews not supposed to follow all of them? This is where we need to view the bible and civilation as a whole as a teaching for people from the ground up. If the bible just said you should love God first and then love others as yourself, would that be enough. I personally believe that everything outlined in Genesis 1-12 (in fact the rest of the bible) on how to live is a derivative of that statement. So then why is the bible so much longer? Well, how do love? what does it look like. Love is so complex and layered. It is not easily undertood except through complex explanation. I personally think love is so complicated that we cannot exaplin it merely through a sophisticated technical essay but rather need stories tohighlight the nuances and intricacies that are part of it in everyday life in a corrupt and fallen world. This is why studying the bible is so helpful as it does an amazing job of highlighting so many of these intricacies and explain in depth how to handle complicated situations with love or the right way. One fact is that sometimes there may be many right ways but that balance is a key component. When parents are teaching young kids how to behave appropriately in society, they are often unable to explain exactly why their kids are not allowed to do certain things are why they force their kids to do certain things to the kids and often have say something like because I sad so and I make the rules. This is becasue the explanation is too technical and difficult for the kid to properly grasp. There are probably better ways to handle the situation above but the point remains that at an early age parts of morality are difficult to understand. This is exactly why God tried to make it as simple as possible to follow his rules that he gave the israelites in Exodus and Leviticus. He told them what to do and say and in some sense restricted their freedom immensely. But I believe this is necessary and the right way to slowly teach an individual, a community and ultimately the world how to live correctly morally. We need to remember that most people in their time are not educated and so having simple rules to follow that pointed in the direction of love is the most helpful thing God could do. The rules He set were often images of how to live and pointed people in the right direction. I am not going to get into the nitty gritty of trying to show what each law represents or why it is there especially because I do not know all of it. But the laws given to the Israelites are similar to the idea of not letting your kid play near the street. There is nothing wrong with playing by the street but since a kid does not know better it could result in a catastrophic disaster. This is necessary I believe even nowadays for people who are new converts who do not understand the subtleties of love. They might need additional rules or restrictions so that they do not do something that goes against helping them become that best person. </p>
<p>It is worth noting to further emphasize the above point that it is not easy to stop doing something that worked counter to you becoming the best version of yourself. This is why protection at young age or ignorant age is important. You may not properly understand why what you are doing it wrong but if you keep doing it only to discover later that it was wrong, it can be firstly very difficult to reverse and there may be other consequences it caused that are hard to reverse. Portnography in children would be one of the obvious horrors. Many kids do not understand the subtle objectification they are teaching themselves on how to treat women and also do not understand the mental side effects particulary on focus and anxiety that it causes. But when they do realize, a lot of damage is already done. Again protection is good and that is why at a younf or ignorant age we should trust those wiser than us. </p>
<p>However, as we get older, sin does not become not doing these protective laws rather it morphs into something way more complicated as we are now tasked with making the difficult decision of what to do when our parents are not there to give us protective laws. We are encouraged to be mature and to face the unknown. We use the biblical laws given in their specific context to help usto understand how to love God, others and ourselves correctly. It is much more complicated but that is why we need to grow up. Asking questions like is it wrong to drink or to hang out with these people no longer has a simple answer like it did when were young and ignorant because there is nothing inherently wrong with drinking or hanging out with anybody. The better question now becomes, is this helping me become the best version of myself. And this question is not purely selfish either because as we spoke about earlier, the best version of ourself involves generosity. It involves caring for people and not objectifying people. It involves inviting in but it also involves have boundaries. We see that sin is much more complicated as the right answer to many of these sitations is not clear. In some sense both decisions could be right. Yes, there are some things that regardless of the situation are not right like rape and murder. But even then with murder, is it murder to leave your wounded friend out on the battlefield to die because carrying him might result in the death of you and two others? The trolley cart dillemma also points out the complexities of morality. The trolley cart scenario asks the question, if you were on a train that did not have breaks and there were three people on the track and it was guarenteed that the cart would kill all three if it hit them unless you pull this lever that takes the cart onto another set of rails that is guarenteed to kill one person. Do you pull the lever? There are many iterations of this scenario -- you can look them up but the idea is that life is complicated. Sometimes there are no right answers and sometimes there are no wrong answers and perhaps it is about trying to make the best of each situation. It is about molding ourselves into the best version of ourselves. </p>
<p>But as we have established this is difficult to do without taking risks and going into the unknown and failing. This adds another complex aspect to life. If sin is missing the mark how is it good for us to fail. Is that not simply missing the mark? This again shows how we cannot define sin as single events so easily although they defeintely can be singular events. Rather sin appears to be aligned with the desires of the heart. Who do we want to become and do we really want it? Or are the hedonistic pleasures of this world and lazy cowardice too tempting. I believe God is inviting us towards the former statemnt and awy from the later and that is truly follwoing God. This is what we are saying when we say we believe in God. </p>
<p>Finally, we look at the heirarchical structure of morality. Like i mentioned earlier, eveything good we can do on this earth is loving. That includes adventure and failure. However, there are some ways in which we can miss the mark that are worse than others and some derivatives are less important than others. Let us start with this analogy. Imagine it is the second world war and you live in Nazi Germany and are currently hiding some Jewish people in your house from the authorities. The authorities come knocking on your door asking if any Jews are staying in your house. Do you lie and say no or tell the truth and say yes. I think quite obviously the right answer is to lie and say no. Which is weird because had you not lied, then purely from a rule following point of view, you would not have sinned, but lying clearly is a sin. To me this is another instance where sin is not so obviously a singular event and sin also does not only correspond to how it effects you. This world is corrupt and often we are asked to make choices that do not have clear morally correct answers. Instead we are asked to find the ultimate source of who we are trying to become and aim for that. Do we want to be someone who stands up for what is right and the rights of others while compassionately sacrificing our potential future for the goodness of the marginalized or do we will want to cower in fear at the tryannical oppression and evil regimes of this world. This is why it is so obvious that lying is the right thing. It is not the right time to stand up against the authorities and say yes but you cannot have them because it is wrong as that would be negligent and would probably not be successful although noble. Again, we see how life is complicated. What this should also open our eyes to see is that because life is complicated we are going to make mistakes even when we were not trying to or did not do on purpose. We often make terrible mistakes ignorantly while trying to do good. Therefore, we need to be able to forgive ourselves and accept the forgiveness that God has offered otherwise, we will be kept down by our own guilt. </p>
<p>The final thing I want to talk about is whether different sins have different or the same consequences. Many christians have been told that any sin is enough to have us fall short of God's glory and is why we need Jesus to save us. While this is not wrong, it completely misses the point of sin. We will not get to heaven and be perfect and complete. If so heaven would be boring. The greatest joy in this world is not found in static pleasure such as drinking margaritas on the beach three steps away from my luxury mansion. This becomes boring very quickly and we all know boredom is a form of hell on earth. It is easy to imagine times as a kid when I had vacation periods and could do anything I wanted to do almost every day of the school year involving play some level of video game, watch tv and not work. Yet, after doing that for a while despite how amazing I thought it was during classes, suddenly became boring and life suddenly was not fun. Everyone can relate to this to some degree. It shows how a static heaven would not be heaven. True happiness is found on this earth by doing something meaningful and growing into a greater person. This is definitely going to be a big part of heaven. How that will look especially if evil will cease to exist, I have no idea. But a dynamic adventurous and meaningful life is what brings the most joy to us. Understanding this, sheds light on why hyper sancitification upon death does not make sense and why sancification in general is so important. Some things are simply hared to unlearn and then learn the right way than others. Furthermore, we need to view sin not solely as something that only affects us but also has something that affects the whol community around us. Therefore, some things we do (which definitely includes our way of life) cause more choas and suffering than others and are more difficult to rectify. Since the ultimate goal is not just complete santification of ourself but complete santification for all, it is clear that some sins are worse than others.</p>
<p>In conclusion, what we showed is that sin can be singular event, a way of life and it effects the whole community. We also saw that the goal is be the best version of ourselves but that the best version of ourselves has the goal of making everyone else the best version of themselves (which is not done via control and force but by love). Therefore, we cannot be the best version of ourselves unless everyone is as well. However, if there was a best version of ourself that we could become, that would result in a static ending which be boring. Therefore, we get to infintely pursue perfection which itself is perfection and is God. And there is nothing truly more glorious than that. That, ultimately, is why we should not sin.</p>
