                <h2 id="vulnerability-trust-and-power">Vulnerability, Trust and Power</h2>
<p>Trust also known as faith is an integral part of many religious traditions. Many people ask the question where is your faith. Trust commonly reffered to as one of the most fundemental aspects within relationships as well. If trust of faith is so important, perhaps we need to define more precisely what it is and how do we get it or improve on it. Power on the other hand is the postmoderns answer to everything. Despite this ignorant and cynical attitude, we see that in many cases the reason is power. In fact, I think we will see that power stands in antithesis to trust. Furthermore, my overarching argument will be that trust which requires love and respect and altruism creates a better life for both the individual and the greater community than power does. The crazy part though is that power is a more successful attitude than doing nothing which is one why its so easy to think that power is the cause of everything and why many people end up resorting to it. </p>
<p>Let us start with power. Power starts with a couple of assumptions. The first of these is that people are inherently selfish and do not care about what happens to other people. These types of arguments are evident in abortion protests where its my body my choice forgetting that there is another human being that is living inside the womb. It is surprising that the intersection between the number of people who are okay with abortion and those who advocate for some level of vegetariansim because harming other animals is evil and cruel is quite high. Perhaps, people only want to act morally superior if it goes with their agenda. But I digress.The second assumpiton is that in order for you to get something out of another person, you need to force or manipulate them to do so. In other words exert power over them. Remember people are selfish and do not care about others. So why would they do something for you. The next aspect of power is a more complicated idea of teaming up with a group of people who are generally like minded and for the good of your team/group they can maniplute/exert power over other groups to attain what is good for their group. Now if you do not already see how this progression is problematic, hopefully it will become clearer as this essay continues. Finally, you can see all the different groups that are more successful because they have been more powerful and have used that power to attain what they want at the expense of the less powerful.</p>
<p>Now, in many cases this is true or atleast there is truth in it. Many people get oppressed for the luxury of the powerful and as a result the oppressed are worse off for it and can often struggle to switch the scales. This is in both group and individual terms. But hopefully by the end of this essay we will see that the powerful in this instance would be better off not oppressing the less powerful even if they can get exactly what they want from doing so.</p>
<p>Let us imagine a scenario. Think of 3 young adult males who are interested in finding a girlfriend and ultimately a wife. They all want to have kids one day to continue their genes and heritage and so much more. Whenever the first guy would meet a girl he would act timid and would hardly say anything. He did not take any risk and ultimately ended up just getting rejected so many times that he gave up entirely. He did not work on himself or change or anyhting and ended up dying single. The second guy loved the sexual pleasure of girls and saw that and his progeny were the only thing he cared about. Because of that he indulged in the hookup lifestyle where he could take advantage of girls for his own pleasure. However, he could never have a proper relationship with any girl because that meant he could not hookup with other girls and he had to put in effort and do things he did not want to do. It also meant that he had to give up some vulnerability which was not worth the risk as he had been hurt before when he previously did. He ended up raping a girl because really what does it matter how she feels and he got what he wanted. He ended up with three kids from different mothers. He never married. The third guy tried a different approach. He took a lot of risks by putting himself out their. He made a lot of friends, worked out got his finances in order, found a job and spoke to as many girls as he could. He found a girlfriend initially but she ended up cheating on him. The he found another girl but she left him too. The he found another but he decided she was not it. After many years of trying and heartbreak, it seemed as if he might as well give up but he kept trying only to have another toxic relationship. Finally, he found the girl of his dreams. He never forced her to do anything instead he was willing to sacrifice. Why? Because he knew from past experience that if he wants a healthy connection with his girlfriend such that it would result in marriage, he needs to be willing to do things that are uncomfortable. But furthermore, he knew that he needed to gain her trust. Having been cheated on in the past, he knew exactly what it meant to be able to trust someone. He knew that was essential to their relationship. And so we have a little happily ever after story here. </p>
<p>We see three different types of people in the thought experiment above. We see that the power hungry person ends up better off than the person who does nothing. And this is important. Because so often it is easy for us to look at a situation and say well I should have just manipulated that person or forced them to do that as it would have resulted in a better outcome. But too often we are comparing incorrectly. Either we are comparing to the first situation where using force does better than not doing anything or we are not comparing long term as the power hungry individual got what he wanted more than the third guy at the beginning.</p>
<p>It is important to look at things from a zoomed out lens over time. More specifically we need to investigate the type of person we are becoming over time. We need to determine whether the person we are becoming is more enjoyable to be. Like I said at the beginning of this essay, I think that someone who people prefer to be around is happier than someone who is lonely. Okay, let us take a step back. There are many assumptions in the last statement so let us flesh them all out. For starters, written inbetween the lines is the idea that the goal in life is to be happy but maybe ever more than just happy its to be as happy as one could possibly be. Now, this statement is not completely obvious. Furthermore, it depends how one defines happy. Some other ideas of what we could desire to be is successful, to leave a legacy, to have achieved a purpose. There are other options that one could add here. Ultimately, I think that we want life to be something that is transcendent. Something that is higher than what we have right now. I think we want our life to be better. We want our life to have made an impact on this world and we want our life to have had an impact on others. We want to be remembered positively. In the bible I think this is what Jesus is referring to when he talks about life and eternal life. It is not just something we can attain after we die, in fact that would be missing the point when reading the bible. The word for eternal (aeonias) in the greek is qualitative word not a quantitative word. It is something that we can experience here on earth. It is something that we want to experience here on earth. One of the greatest travesties of this world is that there is a life that we can experience that is greater, more transcendent, eternal life as it were, but many do not know how. A caveot to this is that I think that is the gospel. That our job is to show others that there is a better way to live. I think fundementally, I cannot deduce further  why we have a higher purpose or a greater calling or that there is something better to be attained in this life. It is easy to look at life cynically and deduce that it is just pain and suffering. It is fatalistic or luck based. But I think that the first principals of this world are that if we live out our purpose by using our skills and abilities to do something positive for the world, if we treat people well and form trust filled relationships, if we are willing to take risks and when we fail get up try again, then our life can result in eternal life. But to prove some of this deductively is very difficult if not impossible.</p>
<p>Okay let us see what we can we prove deductively and let us look at the deductive implications and then let us look at the empirical evidence of the difference options. I think there are three options as identified earlier. Either people are paralyzed by fear, or people oppress others out of fear that they do not have control. This often looks like insecurity. Or finally people triumph over fear learn to trust and take risks. I do not think there is another option. In fact, one could reduce it further, we either live in fear or we do the opposite. I think what you will find is that any action you do in fear either oppresses yourself or someone else. Again, there are assumptions behind that. The first being that people are better off when they grow. Many people think it would be great to play video games your whole life with no responsibility. We think of someone like Dan Bylzarian or our favrite youtuber and assume that is the perfect life. We may undercut their level of responisibilty in their life but in any case, I will try show why I think responsibility is imperative to happiness. Jordan Peterson proposes that happiness is not the ultimate goal in life but rather fulfilling a purpose in life which requires showing responsibility. I think again this depends on the defition of happiness. In one sense what is fulfillness. I think it is a level of overarching or transcendent happiness. In any case whatever that is that is what we want. For the purpose of this essay I will call it total abundant life. Again I think this is what the bible is suggesting is eternal life. But that can be confusing so lets go with total abundant life. </p>
<p>Back to why responsibilty will result in a more abundant life than static hedonistic bliss. The first argument goes back to a conversation I had with an atheist who suggested heaven would become boring quickly. The idea is that doing the same thing again and again becomes monotonous. Great songs when played too often no longer gice the same thrill. Playing the same video game often becomes boring after a while. Even sex the epitome of bliss loses the initial apex thrill after many occasions. However, the argument against that is simply well its still good. In fact, many people spend many hours doing just one thing and often becomeo very good at it. But that there is a self defeating statement because as soon as you get better at something, suddenly you are no longer static. There is some kind of growth. Even sex is something people get better at but what makes sex slightly different is that there is another person who has to like/love you enough to want to have sex with you. Often doing nothing is not good enough. Well what about stuff like porn or drugs or sugar or alcohol. Well, I really do not think I have to make an argument here as to why these things will not provide abundant life in itself. As in if all you did was eat, drink do drugs and watch porn in an attempt to make absolutely no growth and still be happy, I can tell you this will not last very long. </p>
<p>The argument is simple. Without growth, life is not good. Incredibly, having an abundant life does not even seem to require growing in lots of different areas although I think the more one grows in the better. I think the level of an abundant life someone can attain by just working hard at one thing is substantially different working hard at nothing. Having said that, not everything passes as something we can work hard at in life. For example, (to overexaggerate) if someone was to spend all their time trying to be the best at showering and having the perfect shower, that would probably not help them in life as other issues will result in the person dealing with greater issues. Having said that, I think this showering person would still be better off than the porn and drug addict mentioned earlier or even someone that just sits around and watches tv each day.</p>
<p>At the end of the day life is about growing. It is fundemental to having an abundant life. People who grow faster than others often enjoy life more. Now, that needs to be defined well again. One may think of growing as something we learn at school or some kind of academic knowledge growth. This idea would assume that PhDs should be the happiest people on the earth. However, there are so many facets to life that academic knowledge is just one facet of many in life that can incur growth. I would argue, and we will expound on this more later, that people who have the best social skills or people who others want to be around, typically have a more abundant life than others. But even this is not good enough as a stand alone statement. </p>
<p>We have clarified that life requires growth. Now let us look at the things that prevent us from growing. Ultimately, they come down to different forms of fear. The dominant fear is based on the unknown. In order to grow you have to take yourself outside of your comfort zone and do something that is unfamiliar to you. This requires courage. The second thing that prevents us from growing is fatigue and pain. This is a fear that if you continue you will hurt yourself. It is more or a biological fear that your body just cannot actually do it. This shows that fear is not an irrational construct and deserves to be taken seriously. There are very real dangers and there are definitely things that we may be ill equipped to do at any given stage. Fear in this sense keeps us grounded. But we need to not let it paralyze us. Whether it is trying to get fitter or moving to a new city or starting a new job, we need to be put ourselves in an uncomfortable situation in order to grow but there is a limit. We go to that limit and then we stop. We recover. Then next time we can go further. And we repeat this process. If do not do this and let fear paralyze us and we oppress ourselves. We are literally taking that abundant life that we do have access to and we are letting it waste away. This is how we disrespect ourselves. Which when argued from hindsight is a form of self violation. One could simply define it as not loving ourselves. And we wonder why there are so many succesful self help books.</p>
<p>The next aspect of fear worth looking at is control. It lies within insecurity that says I cannot trust someone else therefore, I must take control. This is also a form of anxiousness particularly when anxiousness is not something we can control. In other words its trying to control the uncontrollable. However, we can easily fall into naivety if we trust without fear. Other people are often not as reliable or as good at something as we would hope. Sometimes mistakes happen. We need to take this into account. Otherwise, we are just going to end up getting betrayed, or let down and eventually we cannot play the innocent and unlucky card. We need to be prepared for these things. The questions comes down to then how do we approach the world. Firstly, we need to ercognise that we are not able to control everything and that there needs to be trust. In fact,  you will find yourself trusting in things more often than you think. We trust that our science is right and the world is not just going to blow up or collapse. We trust that our car will work and do as we expect. We trust that raffic light will work. Honestly, the list goes on. Everytime we get in our car and drive to work, we take courage. Now, even though this is a mundane thing we are comfortable doing it becasue we do it everyday. We are able to trust things that are repeatable and consistent. However, often people do not fit this mold particularly in relationships. Furthermore, peolpe change and can become different things. This means that even if someone has remained consistent for a while, things can change seemingly on a whim even though the change was far more gradual. See if you think closely about the two ideas with rehards to fear of growth and fear resulting in control, they really come down to the same thing. The reason we do not want to grow is because we know how to control what we currenlty have. This means that pushing ourselves takes courage. This means that establishing a new relationship takes courage. It is risky and fear is not something we should totally discard. BUt it is necessary. We should take precautions but the issue is there is a point that whatever precautions you want to take, you have to take some leap or step of faith or whatever you want to call it. There is a part where we have to abandon the control and take the risk. To do this we have to be prepared to fail. That is simply the hardest part. But it is part of the growing process. Perhaps you learned something about how you spoke or acted that cost you. Perhaps you just figured out that that person was not soemone good to be friends with or to date. Perhaps, now you have better parameters than before about what type of people to keep in your life. Perhaps you are better at identifying red flags. This is hard, and often we need to go back into our area of control to recuperate. But it is necessary to take the risk of being hurt -- not in a foolish or totally naive manner, which is why we have parents and mentors and teachers. It is necessary because as we established earlier, a totally abundant life is unnattainable without growth. Growth is fundemental to happiness. This means trust is fundemental to happiness. </p>
<p>Let us talk more about trust. Trust has a strong link with vulnerablity. When we trust we make ourselves vulnerable. Fear encourages us to not be vulnerable because if we are too vulnerable we will probably die or get seriously hurt. This is exactly why adam and eve were naked in the garded. They were completely vulnerable. But becasue they did not fear anything they ended up getting hurt. Adam and Eve are clear representatives of all mankind. Is it not interesting that the first story in the bible is about the balance of fear, trust and vulnerablity. It is also about truth but we spoke about that already. I always used to be confused by the statement fear God in the bible. I knew we were told to trust God but I could not undeerstand how we could trust him and fear him. They seem to be at odds with each other. Many people I asked would always say something like it is a term for respect or you only have to fear God if you re not a christian. But I do not think this is what the statement is saying. I think it is about exactly what is written above. You need to have an element of fear otherwise, the snake will take your abundant life. Pure trust and naivety as lovely and wholesome and religious as it sounds is simply not correct. It is story number one of the bible. Obviously, this needs some further explanation. </p>
<p>God is not just a person. He has personality and many aspects of a person but he is way more than that. God also is everything unknown. This may sound like a God of the gaps statement where as we discover more of the universe, God slowly diminishes but this is only part of it. God is also everything we have not yet discovered individually. This is why we are called to trust God. God has set up a universe that has an element of randomness at the human level (obviously we can argue that at the true scientific level everything can be predicted or at least follows a series of cause and effect chains. But you and I have no idea when an earthquake will happen next and furthermore, the freedom of choice within human and animals causes things to change. Therefore randomness is appropriate.) However, he has also set up a way in which we can live that will bring more growth and happiness. The following of this process is epitome of growth. This is why Jesus is the way and the logos/word. God is not just a person. Yes, we can relate to him like a person but limit of God is way too finite. God is everything that we are not. If something can be discovered then that has to exist in God even at the individual level. Trusting in God is follwoing his way he has setup. Fearing God is making sure we are not succombing to the randomness and unpredictability of the universe. If everything was totally predictable, Adam and Eve could have been naked and totally vulnerable so long as they are following in the way God has made for us. But things come up that are unexpected. These things are why we need to fear. The most imprtant verses in Job which are at the center of this highly chiastic book is 'the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and to shun evil is understanding. This is as simple as it gets. Fear God because random unwanted things happen such as all the terrible things that happened to Job. He needed to be prepared for these things to happen. But shuning evil is trusting that God's way is the right way. It is a combintation of both. </p>
<p>There is another type of fear that we have not really explored which is the fear of shame and guilt that paralyses us. This idea again origninates in the story of Adam and Eve and is expounded upon incredibly through the rest of the Torah and then blownup to an incredible height by Jesus. The solution the bible gives is absulutely remarkable. It is this idea that we should live as if we are forgiven. As if that shame and guilt is not on us. It even encourages us to take the shame and guilt off other people by forgiving them. The verse that read forgive others so that God can forgive you used to really confuse me. I was confused by the idea that God had forgiven our sins yet only if we forgave everyone else. But again my idea on what abundant life is was so wrong. When we fail to forgive someone that means we leave a littlw bit of fear left in them that prevents them from growing. That growth is directly related to the relationship you had with them. This can be fleshed out more but not in this essay because often it is on a case by case basis but I will say this: moving on from a broken or tainted relationship is very hard especially as you try to determine what was your fault and what was theirs. Without forgiveness, it is difficult to fully move on as the relationship is still left adrift. Yes, of the other person opts to forgive it may be easier for them to move forward but the relationship is still left unresolved, In other words, unless both people forgive, shame and guilt still remain in both people. Therefore, a lack of forgiveness sucks joy from this world and prevents growth which ultimately is not a good thing. Therefore, not forgiving someone is a form of not forgiving yourself as you still contributed to making the world a worse place. </p>
<p>Another thing I want to say about forgiveness is that forgiveness does not mean that you should let other live as corruptly as they want and then let them off the hook. In contrary, forgiving is more about teaching other people what they have done wrong while being willing to bear the consequences of what they did. The bible is a strong proponent of repentance. But repentance is much more complicated than just saying sorry. In jewish tradition there is 5 step process to repentance and one of the steps is going and making it right with the person you hurt. This means not just saying sorry to God and not just saying sorry to the other person but actively doing something that will completely compensate for the damage done. In the torah, it speaks about how you often have to pay back more than the wrong you did because there is a recognition that sinning violating someone does not just take things a way from them but goes deeper. But the process is all about realizing what you have done, what the imapcts are, why its wrong, who you've hurt, how badly you have hurt them then going out and trying to fix it. Often the damage done is more than can be repaid. Violation always goes deeper. This is why forgiveness is essential. It is almost impossible to reverse the bad you have done. Thereofore, someone forgiving you is them taking the burden on themselves and bearing the suffering that goes with it. It is a crazy idea that in order to have greater personal and communal happines and abundant life lies within being able to accept and take some of the suffering caused to you by someone who hurt you. We selfishly want other people to pay for all the hurt they caused but one of the most important aspects is that, they simply cannot regardless of how willing they are to try.</p>
<p>This is why the concept of God incarnate coming to earth and taking on all that suffering is a truly revolutionary idea. But I guess it is more than an idea, it is a reality. It is this simple reality that prevents people from dying with their sins and an eternal corruption of the world. This is in the a most metaphyiscal way God literally saving the world. Whenever someone dies with their sins unpaid for, nu</p>
