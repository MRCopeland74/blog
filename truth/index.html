<p>Truth is a topic that many debate in our current age. Many are happy to uphold a historical, scientific or Mathematics concept of truth that holds for all times and places in the correct sense. But when it comes to theological, moral or philosophical truth, for some reason this idea seems to be no longer relevant. For example, we are happy to state that gravity exists throughout the world regardless of whether you believe it is there or not. We are happy to state that 7+12=19. We are happy to state that 9/11 happened in 2001. We state these as matters of truth. Anyone who does not believe in these things we (at least in our mind) think they are just simply incorrect. If these questions were asked in a test at school, if you said gravity does not exist, 7+12 =14 or 9/11 did not happen you would be marked incorrect and no one would bat an eye. This is important. If these answers could have been marked either correct or incorrect then we have an issue because we would not be able to trust anything. Imagine going through life and receiving an income and not knowing how much that will add to your saving/checking account. Imagine going through life not knowing whether gravity will work or not and potentially just start floating. Imagine going through life not knowing whether what you remember happened yesterday (or in the past in general) actually happened. Life simply would not work. It would be complete chaos. Therefore, truth in its simplest definition is what brings order to chaos. Truth allows us to know that things on this earth are reliable and trustworthy.</p>
<p>This brings us to the current post modern dilemma. If truth is necessary for us to make sense of how we live in this world based on history, science and mathematics, what about theology, morality and philosophy. Is it possible to have two contradicting moral codes true at the same time? The answer to this has to be no, however, there is a nuance to it that we will talk about later. If this is the case, then how do you determine whether someone is guilty or not. To put it blankly, if person A thinks murder is a good thing while person B thinks murder is wrong, how do you determine if person B is guilty if they kill someone. Do we just say its okay to murder so that we do not infringe on person B’s beliefs and say well if person A does not want to murder then just do not, its not like they are forced to murder? This clearly does not work and we know that inherently but perhaps we need to look at the fundamental reason behind it. Person A and person B have a completely different view of what gives each person the right to life. Person B is essentially saying that they get to subjectively decide whether someone deserves to live or not. If they do not want someone in this world, they have the right to end to end their life. On the other hand, person A is saying, I cannot be the one to decide whether someone deserves to live or not. There needs to be someone or something objective that can determine this for us. This way we eliminate bias. (You might think this is an outrageous example but I ask you to think about abortion reread the example). </p>
<p>Bias and subjectivity go hand in hand. There are many ways the world has attempted to address the issue of bias. One way is the social contract. If most of the population agrees on a particular issue, then it is decided that we have eliminated bias and now can make a more objective decision as to what is morally correct. We also see this in the court room in which they have multiple randomly selected jurors (at least in America). However, we come to an issue with the social contract in that people are limited in knowledge. People throughout history have made terrible moral decisions. Think about the number of people that followed Hitler in Germany or the number of people that wanted slavery in the US or the number of people who voted for the national party in South Africa to continue implementing Apartheid (segregation). Many of these people did not think of themselves as evil or even doing something evil, yet they were clearly facilitating and supporting some very evil regimes. Furthermore, if we go back in time, almost everybody believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that everything rotated around it. This we now know is clearly wrong. If we can make scientific mistakes in the past, what is it to say that we can not make moral mistakes now. Yes, we are evolving as a people and our understanding of truth, but that does not change the fact that something is true. 1000 years ago, the earth was still rotating around the sun and not the center of the universe. 1000 years ago, slavery was wrong. 1000 years ago racism was still wrong. This is all true whether we are in India, England, Serbia, Ghana, in a boat, on a mountain, etc. Even though people did not believe that does not change those facts. This is truth. </p>
<p>The simple reality of truth is that when we follow it, order comes to this world. We eliminate chaos. Evil and suffering is a result of chaos. Therefore, if we know that truth exists and it does not depend on time or place, and we know that we are as a people are slowly discovering it as time goes on, then there has to be something outside of us that defines truth. If it were us, we would have found it. But since we are evolving towards truth and discovering it as we go along, who or what set the standard that we are trying to attain? If the answer is the universe, I ask you how something comprised of only matter and forces determined morality. One might say the universe made a certain morality conducive to optimal living, but that implies that the universe has a motive and is more than just matter and forces. Either way we get to a God that is no longer defined by science.</p>
<p>This post is not going to go into why I think it is the God of the bible that is true (another post) but for now all statements will Assume that it is the Christian God that is true. The bible starts with a story that says almost exactly what we have been talking about. In Genesis firstly, we see God bring order to chaos in Genesis one then in Genesis two we are introduced to two trees. One is the tree of life and the other is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God forbids us from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But why? what is so bad about this tree. Why is it not just the tree of evil or the tree of death? The serpent then comes along and says that eating from the tree will make us like God which God also affirms in Genesis three. Why is this a problem? You see the issue here is God has defined how the universe works. He created it and brought order or truth to it. But when we decide to take the place of God and decide what good and evil is, we are biased. We have limited knowledge and experience. We have preferences. Ice cream is good. This makes it so easy for us to treat morality like a preference or like an ice cream. Is it not crazy that the cardinal original sin that man committed was deciding by ourselves what is good and evil. Yet, right now we live in a world that encourages exactly that. We have treated truth like it is a preference. But truth is objective. It does not matter whether you like gravity or not, it exists and you have to deal with it. Your opinion of it does not matter. It is the same with morality. To think that we get to decide morality is to commit the cardinal original sin and is playing God. Therefore, quite simply if God says something is true, then guess what… it is true. We should follow it. Because he designed the universe, what he says is true is what will bring the universe out of the chaos that we plunged it back into in Genesis three.</p>
<p>Now here is where it gets interesting. What is it that the bible actually says is true regarding morality. There are 613 laws in the Old Testament. Is that what we are supposed to follow? Here is what I propose. In the new testament Jesus tells us that the two most important commandments are to Love God and love others and that these two commandments fulfill all the laws. I will explain this in greater depth in a later post, but essentially in the Old Testament God was giving us all these laws to teach us what love looks like and how to live it out. But everything can be summed up with love. Therefore, the only truth for morality that God gives us is love. It is about determining what the loving thing to do in each unique situation this chaotic world brings up. But before you commit the cardinal sin again and decide that what you are doing is loving, the challenge would be to read and study the bible and the examples it gives to learn why some things are loving and why some things are not. On top of that, we can use empirical evidence, logic and science to help us determine what is loving as well. </p>
<p>But it gets more complicated than this. There are some things that are clearly grey. Alcohol is one of these topics. Dating is another. The question becomes how much alcohol is good. Living a drunken life is wrong but what about in-between. Dating as well. how should that look? These are complicated topics but Paul dresses this in a couple of places one of them being Romans 14. What at face value seems like a weird chapter promoting post modernism is actually the issue of grey that perhaps post modernism was trying to address but went too far. The idea is that for some people it is perfectly permissible to drink alcohol. They do not struggle with any sort of addiction to it and do not look to it for comfort and escapism but rather do it socially in moderation to improve relationships. Others however, may have been alcoholics in the past and any alcohol could trigger them into a bad downhill slide. The point is that people who drink alcohol have no right to force the sober people to drink but at the same time the sober people have no right in telling the alcohol drinkers that they are sinful and bad people. This should be really easy for a post modern to understand but many who are completely against post modernism forget that there are still some instances where it is grey and subjective per person. Oh but how many of us are there that are alcohol drinkers that should be sober? This can be an analogy applied to all different types of grey area issues. What is the objective loving thing to do? As Paul says that we should not let our christian freedom be used as an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another. (Galatians 5:13)</p>
<p>There we have it. God designed the universe. He designed theology, morality, philosophy, science, math, etc. These things all are designed as components of truth that are designed to bring order to chaos. When we go against them we create chaos which creates chaos and suffering. These things do not change by time or place only in sense. I.e it will always be true to love but that can look different in different circumstances. As we go through this world we will discover what is true. God gave us a big head start with morality but culture changes and it is our job to continually adapt and figure out how to love best in different cultures. We will also continue to discover truth in all the other components. But discovering does not mean it was created but rather it was foundational from the beginning.</p>
