Love is the true definition of purpose although in later blogs we will talk about how that purpose looks slightly more practically. This blog will define love. Now if you have not read the previous blog on truth, you should do that first as it explains how we know something is true and gives the context to love. Love is the backbone to all morality. What we will be doing today is looking at the laws God gives to determine how to love. Therefore, the best place to start is in genesis. Now if we start with the prolog to the Abraham story, we have several incredible stories about how God sets up this universe. Since this is not an in depth study of genesis, I will be pointing out the major points (and sometimes the link or evidence might not be so clear. I will go through these stories in more depth at a later point). In Genesis 1:1-3, we already see God\u2019s intention with the world. The word Elohim meaning God has the connotation of a judge. Now, in Hebrew, the point of a judge is to restore things to order. This has two sides, punishment/destruction or forgiveness and mercy. Either way the goal is restoration. God never does something outside of the intention of restoration. This is exactly what we see God do in these verses. The universe is chaotic nothingness and God then says let there be light. This is the first step in restoring order. He then spends the rest of genesis one bring order to the chaos. Then in Genesis 3 we sin and bring chaos back into the world. The rest of the bible is God revealing his plan on how he is bringing order back to this world. The difference is, we are involved with it and it is our job to do our part in bringing order to chaos in this world. Okay so far we know that our purpose has to do with bringing order to chaos. Therefore, love has to do the same thing. If what you do does not bring order to this world, it is not love but if what you do does bring order to this world, then it is love. Okay, but how do we know if something brings order? Well that is what the bible will help us understand. Next stop the tower of babel. The tower of babel has become one of my favorite stories once I finally understood what it was saying. It is way more complicated than what I will explain here and it is interlinked with the Noah story and the garden of eden story. The links are fascinating and brilliant but for another time. The main point of the tower of babel story lies in the line, we will make a name for ourselves. This statement is beautifully juxtaposed to the beginning of the Abraham story. Abraham chooses Sarah knowing she is barren. Therefore, he sacrifices his own chance to have children and a heritage in order to restore honor to Sarah\u2019s father and show compassion on Sarah. This is a huge commitment and one that certainly does not benefit Abrahams name. Does that ring a bell? You see the reason God chose Abraham while he ended the plans of the people trying to build a giant tower is because of whose name they were doing it for. The tower of babel did it for their own name while Abraham did it for someone else name. Okay, so we are making progress. The first definition of restoring order is when we make someone else\u2019s name great and not ours. We are willing to sacrifice our own name for success of someone else. There is a lot in genesis about what making someone else\u2019s name great looks like but we will skip most of it for the sake of brevity but two things worth paying attention too are: how important hospitality is and reconciliation between broken relationships. The hospitality we see in Abraham, Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah, and Rebekah. The reconciliation we see between Jacob and Esau, Rachel and Leah, and Joseph and his brothers. Moving to exodus. We are introduced to the law but particularly the 10 commandments. These seemingly simple commandments are so much richer than most think. First let\u2019s list the commandments. I am the Lord your God You shall have no other gods before me, you shall not make an idol for yourself You shall not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. You shall keep the sabbath holy Honor your mother and father Do not murder Do not commit adultery Do not steal Do not bear false witness Do not covet anyone\u2019s possessions Now we know that the 10 commandments had two tablets. Therefore the first thing you think about is there must be link between the first half and the second half. You would be right. Now if we look at the first five and the second five, what is common to each side. What we see is the first five are the relationship between you and your creators and the second five is the relationship between you and your peers or everyone else. Now what is the link? Creator Command Peer Command Link I am the Lord your God Do not murder Do not do away with others. You shall have no other gods before me, you shall not make an idol for yourself Do not commit adultery Do not betray relationships. You shall not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Do not steal Do not sabotage someone\u2019s dignity. You shall keep the sabbath holy Do not bear false witness Do not sabotage someone\u2019s reputation. Honor your mother and father Do not covet anyone\u2019s possessions Do not violate your own life. Let\u2019s talk more about these links. Why would you want to murder someone. It would be because you do not want them in your life. Another way you can do that is by ignoring them. And that is exactly what we do with God. Jesus took this further and said if you\u2019re angry you have committed murder. We can see that the first thing you want when you are angry at someone is for them to no longer exist or be out of your life. Now what happens when your commit adultery? You betray a relationship. That is exactly what you do when you put idols before God. Jesus says if you look at someone in lust, you have committed adultery. It is easy to see how you have betrayed that relationship in your heart as you are putting someone else ahead of a more important relationship. Lust always has the meaning of exploiting something or someone for your own pleasure. When it comes to sexuality, it looks like adultery. Notice, the betrayal of a relationship doesn\u2019t start with the goal to spite or betray the original relationship but rather a selfish desire pleasure yourself. However, as usual when we put ourselves ahead of others especially in a lustful manner, others often get hurt. What about God\u2019s name and stealing. One thing to note is that the word in the Torah used for steal suggests kidnapping. When we steal we violate someone\u2019s dignity. We do not care about their worth or who they are. Taking God\u2019s name in vain is the same thing. We are taking what God has and we are tarnishing it. Each person has inherent not based on what we do. When we take advantage of someone because we think they are less than or don\u2019t deserve what they have for our own selfish gain, we violate their own God given value. With regards to sabbath and lying, we change from violating inherent value to reputation. We are discarding what the actions of that person or even sabotaging them. When God created the world he rested at the end. Therefore as an ode to Hod we rest as well to acknowledge he is our creator and has ultimate control. The Jews also remember the sabbath as a remembrance for how God brought them out of Egypt. Both these acts acknowledge what God did. When we violate sabbath, we are lying about what God has done. We should instead be celebrating the good works of others and not seeking to lie for own personal gain. But furthermore if someone else has done something bad we should not lie about it for personal gain. The truth wins out and must be made known. The last relationship is about being content with who you are. We need to recognize that our parents gave us life and should honor them for it. If we spite them for that we violate ourselves as we undermine our own existence. It\u2019s the same with coveting. It\u2019s this idea that you want to be someone else. We need to recognize that God has given us value and he loves us. He knitted us together in our mothers womb and has a purpose for our lives. Now we get to the third layer. We can see how each relationship has to do with violation. We start with violation of their physical existence. We then have a violation of relationships. Next is a violation of inherent value. Followed by a violation of action. This results in a total violation of self. Which is why the final violation is a recognition that if someone else cannot be violate then I should not be violated either. Rabbi Hillel was asked how would you sum up the Torah. His response was don\u2019t do to others what you would despise. It is easy to see as we went through the Ten Commandments exactly what Hillel was saying. What we can also see is that these commandments are more about respect than love. This is because we can\u2019t love unless we first respect the person. Love is the creation of a union but if this union is not based on respect then it will turn into abuse. This is why Jesus took Hillel\u2019s comment further and turned it positive. Do to others as you would like to be treated. What we see from Jesus is more of an emphasis to create relationships. He definitely still emphasizes respect but is encouraging a complete union of people. Which leads us to the most important commandments: love God with everything and love others as yourself. The as yourself is the interesting add on here. You see how since this statement is based on respect which is a reference to the Ten Commandments, we need to respect ourselves in fact love ourselves before we can love others. This means love starts with individuals and slowly combines with others to create communities until we are one in mind and goal. This is an obvious call back to the Tower of Babel where there the people were one in mind and goal. The difference is the goal won\u2019t be to make their own name great but rather God\u2019s name great. This is what the Jews refer to as the messianic age, what Jesus calls the kingdom of grace and what we call the new heavens and new earth. However, there is one element missing to love. It is the idea that love is linked to purpose. We see God map out our purpose in Genesis one and two that we should. (We will map out this in more detail in a later blog). These purposes are about imitating God in creating and relationships. Since love is about creating a union in order to execute Gods purpose for us, love needs to be about technological advancement, human propagation as well as a union in mind and goal with respect. All this to glorify God.","title":"What is Love: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"LOVE/#what-is-love-fundamentals-to-christianity","text":"Love is the most fundamental thing to understand as a christian or as any person.

All this to glorify God.","title":"What is Love: fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"Psychology%2C%20Christianity%20and%20the%20Bible/","text":"Psychology, Christianity and the Bible The bible is the groundbreaking truth before all truths on how to live. Since truth presumes love, the bible in essence is love in words. Love is the very thing the reaches for the ultimate good within society and for the world over all future generations. Love is also not a state or goal but a mode of the epitome of being. Psychology is the study of the human mind and how it produces behavior. It does not take much to see that the connection psychology and love, although not congruent as love is more encompassing, is obvious. The goal of this essay is to show how the bible reveals its love and truth in the psychological realm. We will start off by going thorugh the major struggles within life and how the bible helps us to work through them. Then we will work through how the bible encourages us to grow and the psycholgical links there. Then we will start to theorise the ideal of the indivual and finish up with the ideal of society. Some of the most popular mental health issues in people are acceptance vs rejection, self-worth, depression, anxiety, loneliness, addiction, destroyed reputation and bullying. Many of these are linked of entertwined and so we will deal with the core basis of these and then show how part of the solution is growth which leads into the next section. But to start off, we see that there are a couple of core aspects to the christian message. These are your sins are forgiven and you are loved and adopted and part of God's family. Many christians think that you have to accept God into your heart before your sins are forgiven and you are part of God's family. But I believe this is the wrong way around. The grounds of salvation actually begin when you realize that your sins are forgiven and you are part of God's family. Now why is this distinction important? Firstly, recognizing that your sins are forgiven is salvation out of guilt and shame. Many people are trapped in their own guilt where they are not able to forgive themselves for what they have done. This is why satan means accuser because the ultimate damnation is to live in the guilt of your own sin. This is why the ultimate triumph over satan is the forgiveness of sins. Now, the bible makes it very clear that we are each indivually prominent perpetrators and sinful from the core. The bible further emphsizes this idea that we cannot save ourselves but are rather saved by grace. This is a further fascinating addition to the idea of having our sins forgiven as it emphsizes that the ultimate goal of God (for lack of a better word) is the love which points to redemption and Aquinas' beatific vision. This means that our sins being forgiven is a path to a better world. However, it takes the humility of recoginizing the sin within us and understanding the damage we can do. Therefore, we live by the spirit which is love. So to make this slightly simpler, God forgave us as a recognition that redemption and exoneration will result in a greater world. The salvation aspect of this is the literal belief in the fact that our sins are forgiven and that despite the huge encouragement not to sin (as that prevents growth but more on that later), we are able to be free of guilt. This is the first step remedy to many of the mental health illnesses listed above. The second part of the statement: we are part of God's family is just as imprtant to believe as being forgiven only solves part of the problem. One may believe their sins are forgiven but without adoption into the family of God there is no true redemption. One of the greatest issues resulting in mental health problems is being rejected. Which is why God accepts us regardless. We see our sins are forgiven so we do not have to worry about there being any barrier between us and God so that we can be fully accepted. One of the quickest ways to cause mental health issues for kids is for their parents to suggest that they are not good enough of fail to show they are accepted and loved. Anything that a kid cannot confess to their parent is a barrier between the parent and kid. This means that the kid is not fully accepted and not fully loved. There is a gap in vulnerability which prevents the relationship from becoming total. This may not be possible in some human relationships from parent to kid and less so between to spouses but with God it can be total if we have the humility to confess everything. We have a connection here between the idea that first we can be fully accepted by God which is again something that we have full access to but need the humility to confess. The result then goes if we confess our sins God will forgive our sins (because we need to recognize our sin and admit that the guit is putting barriers between us and God) and this will enable us to be fully accepted (sound similar to a famous bible verse?). This is a huge step in resolving most mental illnesses particularly addiction. Now that we have confessed our sins in humility and vulnerability, and have recognized our forgiven sins such that we are living guilt free and in a close relationship with God, we can start to see how these outworkings can help us grow. The first recognition we need to have is that since we are forgiven, then so is everyone else. That means we cannot hold any grudge against anyone because that is attempting to force someone else to live in guilt. But when we go against the hopeful order of God we end up hurting ourself more than them. This is because we have put a barrier between us and that person. This is problematic because that would be a definition of sin. If you think about it, sin is anything that puts a barrier between two or more poeple. When we sin against someone, we do not want to be around them because they hurt us. Now sometimes, it may not be obvious at the time of the sin for example negligence in a toxic relationship, but when everything is figured out and brought to truth, there is a clear barrier between the two people. This means that not forgiving is a sin. It is also a way not to confess sin, which makes it such that it cannot be forgiven not because God is damning but because for their to be salvation within that part of your life it needs to be confessed. This is why we get the bible verse that says something like God will forgive you if you forgive others. Very similar arguments can be made for confessing your sins to others as well as thanking and even praising others. Confessing is obvious but thanking and praising are more complicated. The simple idea however, follows that if we fail to thank someone for doing something nice for us or fail to praise them for doing something great, we have fail to show appreciation for what they have done and attempt to place them below us as if there is some competition or heirarchy between us from a morality perspective. The result is simply that we have put a barrier between us in the relationship. It is not difficult to see how not doing these things can be an attempt to objectify the other person. This is a similar issue that happened in the garden of eden. This also shows that the seemingly insane statement that we often here in church stating that it is right to give him thanks and praise is not so insane but is also part of the confession of sins. This leads us to a recognition of how relationships should look between us fellow humans -- a relationship not characterized by competition and power but by love. Every way we treat other people should be in line with how we treat God and often is an outflowing of how your relationship with god looks. Hence, the greatest two commandments are love God with everything you have and love others as you love yourself. We love God through being thankful for who we are, for recognizing we are not perfect and have sinned and that he has saved us. We also praise him and join his family. This process leads to us loving ourself as we now are not living by guilt and are fully accepted by God. This now eneables us to see how we should treat others and enable us to love others. These three things are completely connected and rely on each other. If there is a lack of love in how we view God, we cannot love ourself properly and we cannot love others properly. One might object and say well how does someone who does not believe in God live a seemingly normal life? How do they love people? Well the simple solution to this is that the way people live often resembles something similar to belief in God. God is such a complicated idea and so encompassing and is impossible to understand fully which simply results in an inability for us to love perfectly. God is made up of all that is good but also all that is unknown as well as the actualilty behind everything. Because there will alsways be things that we individually and collectively do not know, our love will always be incomplete. This meshed with our selfish and impulsive desires results in sin continuing to exist. Many religions teach people to forgive themselves and forgive others and many psychologists teach this too. Many parents accept and love their kids and many times in marriages people love and accept each other. Often friendships also have this sort of natural result. These psychological acts in which we use a close friend as a representative in how we love God (this is not idolatry but rather living out the love of God practically) can result in people having their own level of salvation. But unless people are able to believe that there is something outside of the world that defines goodness, love and truth, and that this thing/being is working towards ultimate redemption, there will be an obvious incomplete love. Often outside of religious circles, it is okay to put up barriers with people that they do not like (these are not barriers of protection and precaution which are often necessary but are rather barriers of sin caused by unforgiveness, unrepentance, objectification or moral competition within the relationship). Having said that, I know many christians who do the same thing especially when it comes to some level of moral pride in which they hold others in moral contempt. One main aspect of love is the unity of two or more people for the creation of something greater than the separation of the individuals. However, this unity can only be loving unity if there is mutual respect between the two. Respect is anti-violation. Any violation or abuse between the two parties puts up barriers which prevents a loving relationship. I wrote another blog post on love and respect. (Remember their are two types of barriers, their are sinful barriers which prevent a loving relationship and there are protection barriers which protect us from being hurt both physcially and emoitonally by people). But an additional aspect of love is growing as an individual. There is a reason 25 year olds typically are not freinds with 9 years. If you have a 9 year old maturity and have lived 25 years, you will struggle to find friends. Some people are often more fun and interesting to spend time with. Even if you are a kind person who does not hurt anyone, you may still not be popular or have friends. It may make it harder for you to find a girlfriend/boyfriend. The list of issues may go on but the backbone still remians that we need to live with full respect of others. Often fulfillment within relatinoships depend on growth within ourselves. In general, men and women who do not take care of themselves and live in chaos and do not have a house, car and job will struggle to find a wife or husband. When we are born we have interests and skills that we tend to be better at than other things. One of the main objectives is to work relly hard at those skills and interests to such that you can get a job and start to produce in this world. In general, the goal is to produce more than you consume. Often however, getting a job is not just about being good at one thing but also requires at least a decent level of communication skills. These go together in helping us mature as they help us to be a greater help to society and are able to communicate our love. more on communication being prepared for bad times call to adventure","title":"Psychology, Christianity and the Bible"},{"location":"Psychology%2C%20Christianity%20and%20the%20Bible/#psychology-christianity-and-the-bible","text":"The bible is the groundbreaking truth before all truths on how to live. Since truth presumes love, the bible in essence is love in words. Love is the very thing the reaches for the ultimate good within society and for the world over all future generations. Love is also not a state or goal but a mode of the epitome of being. Psychology is the study of the human mind and how it produces behavior. It does not take much to see that the connection psychology and love, although not congruent as love is more encompassing, is obvious. The goal of this essay is to show how the bible reveals its love and truth in the psychological realm. We will start off by going thorugh the major struggles within life and how the bible helps us to work through them. Then we will work through how the bible encourages us to grow and the psycholgical links there. Then we will start to theorise the ideal of the indivual and finish up with the ideal of society. Some of the most popular mental health issues in people are acceptance vs rejection, self-worth, depression, anxiety, loneliness, addiction, destroyed reputation and bullying. Many of these are linked of entertwined and so we will deal with the core basis of these and then show how part of the solution is growth which leads into the next section. But to start off, we see that there are a couple of core aspects to the christian message. These are your sins are forgiven and you are loved and adopted and part of God's family. Many christians think that you have to accept God into your heart before your sins are forgiven and you are part of God's family. But I believe this is the wrong way around. The grounds of salvation actually begin when you realize that your sins are forgiven and you are part of God's family. Now why is this distinction important? Firstly, recognizing that your sins are forgiven is salvation out of guilt and shame. Many people are trapped in their own guilt where they are not able to forgive themselves for what they have done. This is why satan means accuser because the ultimate damnation is to live in the guilt of your own sin. This is why the ultimate triumph over satan is the forgiveness of sins. Now, the bible makes it very clear that we are each indivually prominent perpetrators and sinful from the core. The bible further emphsizes this idea that we cannot save ourselves but are rather saved by grace. This is a further fascinating addition to the idea of having our sins forgiven as it emphsizes that the ultimate goal of God (for lack of a better word) is the love which points to redemption and Aquinas' beatific vision. This means that our sins being forgiven is a path to a better world. However, it takes the humility of recoginizing the sin within us and understanding the damage we can do. Therefore, we live by the spirit which is love. So to make this slightly simpler, God forgave us as a recognition that redemption and exoneration will result in a greater world. The salvation aspect of this is the literal belief in the fact that our sins are forgiven and that despite the huge encouragement not to sin (as that prevents growth but more on that later), we are able to be free of guilt. This is the first step remedy to many of the mental health illnesses listed above. The second part of the statement: we are part of God's family is just as imprtant to believe as being forgiven only solves part of the problem. One may believe their sins are forgiven but without adoption into the family of God there is no true redemption. One of the greatest issues resulting in mental health problems is being rejected. Which is why God accepts us regardless. We see our sins are forgiven so we do not have to worry about there being any barrier between us and God so that we can be fully accepted. One of the quickest ways to cause mental health issues for kids is for their parents to suggest that they are not good enough of fail to show they are accepted and loved. Anything that a kid cannot confess to their parent is a barrier between the parent and kid. This means that the kid is not fully accepted and not fully loved. There is a gap in vulnerability which prevents the relationship from becoming total. This may not be possible in some human relationships from parent to kid and less so between to spouses but with God it can be total if we have the humility to confess everything. We have a connection here between the idea that first we can be fully accepted by God which is again something that we have full access to but need the humility to confess. The result then goes if we confess our sins God will forgive our sins (because we need to recognize our sin and admit that the guit is putting barriers between us and God) and this will enable us to be fully accepted (sound similar to a famous bible verse?). This is a huge step in resolving most mental illnesses particularly addiction. Now that we have confessed our sins in humility and vulnerability, and have recognized our forgiven sins such that we are living guilt free and in a close relationship with God, we can start to see how these outworkings can help us grow. The first recognition we need to have is that since we are forgiven, then so is everyone else. That means we cannot hold any grudge against anyone because that is attempting to force someone else to live in guilt. But when we go against the hopeful order of God we end up hurting ourself more than them. This is because we have put a barrier between us and that person. This is problematic because that would be a definition of sin. If you think about it, sin is anything that puts a barrier between two or more poeple. When we sin against someone, we do not want to be around them because they hurt us. Now sometimes, it may not be obvious at the time of the sin for example negligence in a toxic relationship, but when everything is figured out and brought to truth, there is a clear barrier between the two people. This means that not forgiving is a sin. It is also a way not to confess sin, which makes it such that it cannot be forgiven not because God is damning but because for their to be salvation within that part of your life it needs to be confessed. This is why we get the bible verse that says something like God will forgive you if you forgive others. Very similar arguments can be made for confessing your sins to others as well as thanking and even praising others. Confessing is obvious but thanking and praising are more complicated. The simple idea however, follows that if we fail to thank someone for doing something nice for us or fail to praise them for doing something great, we have fail to show appreciation for what they have done and attempt to place them below us as if there is some competition or heirarchy between us from a morality perspective. The result is simply that we have put a barrier between us in the relationship. It is not difficult to see how not doing these things can be an attempt to objectify the other person. This is a similar issue that happened in the garden of eden. This also shows that the seemingly insane statement that we often here in church stating that it is right to give him thanks and praise is not so insane but is also part of the confession of sins. This leads us to a recognition of how relationships should look between us fellow humans -- a relationship not characterized by competition and power but by love. Every way we treat other people should be in line with how we treat God and often is an outflowing of how your relationship with god looks. Hence, the greatest two commandments are love God with everything you have and love others as you love yourself. We love God through being thankful for who we are, for recognizing we are not perfect and have sinned and that he has saved us. We also praise him and join his family. This process leads to us loving ourself as we now are not living by guilt and are fully accepted by God. This now eneables us to see how we should treat others and enable us to love others. These three things are completely connected and rely on each other. If there is a lack of love in how we view God, we cannot love ourself properly and we cannot love others properly. One might object and say well how does someone who does not believe in God live a seemingly normal life? How do they love people? Well the simple solution to this is that the way people live often resembles something similar to belief in God. God is such a complicated idea and so encompassing and is impossible to understand fully which simply results in an inability for us to love perfectly. God is made up of all that is good but also all that is unknown as well as the actualilty behind everything. Because there will alsways be things that we individually and collectively do not know, our love will always be incomplete. This meshed with our selfish and impulsive desires results in sin continuing to exist. Many religions teach people to forgive themselves and forgive others and many psychologists teach this too. Many parents accept and love their kids and many times in marriages people love and accept each other. Often friendships also have this sort of natural result. These psychological acts in which we use a close friend as a representative in how we love God (this is not idolatry but rather living out the love of God practically) can result in people having their own level of salvation. But unless people are able to believe that there is something outside of the world that defines goodness, love and truth, and that this thing/being is working towards ultimate redemption, there will be an obvious incomplete love. Often outside of religious circles, it is okay to put up barriers with people that they do not like (these are not barriers of protection and precaution which are often necessary but are rather barriers of sin caused by unforgiveness, unrepentance, objectification or moral competition within the relationship). Having said that, I know many christians who do the same thing especially when it comes to some level of moral pride in which they hold others in moral contempt. One main aspect of love is the unity of two or more people for the creation of something greater than the separation of the individuals. However, this unity can only be loving unity if there is mutual respect between the two. Respect is anti-violation. Any violation or abuse between the two parties puts up barriers which prevents a loving relationship. I wrote another blog post on love and respect. (Remember their are two types of barriers, their are sinful barriers which prevent a loving relationship and there are protection barriers which protect us from being hurt both physcially and emoitonally by people). But an additional aspect of love is growing as an individual. There is a reason 25 year olds typically are not freinds with 9 years.

And many would think this should be the end of the blog post but somehow we have confused what it means to exist and the existence of other things. Existence has multiple facets to it. Let\u2019s start with a person and work outwards. Each person obviously has a physical body. This body works amazingly well as we have discovered in biology. This part of us keeps us alive and allows us to interact with the physical world. This physical body is totally unique to any other person in the world. However, each person has an essence which is common between all humans such that we can identify someone as a human despite them being unique and different from all other humans. Now, this is where it gets complicated. If something is created that means it was created for a purpose. It is not possible to create something without a purpose. Now the fact that all humans have the same essence must mean that we have either the same purpose or the purpose is derived in a similar way, yet because we have unique bodies, the way in which we will accomplish these purposes has to be different. The next important step is that we see God says we are his image bearers. Therefore, at the core of our essence and therefore purpose is to image God or to act like God. Since, God is not a physical being, our purpose can not be related to our physical attributes. For example, Catholics often talk about not being allowed to use contraception. They derive this idea from sex having an purpose of union and procreations. Therefore because contraception prevents procreation, it\u2019s is sinful. This article is not going to argue about any that but rather just point out that that is outside the essence of God. Instead we derive purpose from God which amazingly turns out to be about those two things \u2014 creating and relationships. Therefore, we see sex (a physical attribute) be used to fulfill our purpose as opposed to something we derive purpose from. This is the right template to follow: how can we use our physical body and the physical world to fulfill God\u2019s purpose for us. To continue this idea, other philosophers talk about every thing in the world having an essence and they go further and say therefore each thing has a purpose. They come to this conclusion by stating that we put things into categories and can tell which is which despite things being unique. However, this only categorizes God\u2019s purpose for them. They do not show us our purpose but rather can be used to fulfill our God imaging purpose. Therefore, we should view things in this world as tools or obstacles. Each thing is either something that helps us achieve our purposes or hinders us. How and whether it is a tool or obstacle depends on a robust understanding of our purpose which is in a different blog post. Now, in addition to an essence and physical body, we also have a conscious. This conscious is the part of us that firstly realizes we exist but secondly allows us to have free will. This is the part of us that allows us to act according to our purpose or deviate to from it. Furthermore, our conscious is linked to our mind which has the ability to learn. This enables us to fulfill our purpose in a fuller way or better way. The less we know, the more instinctually we can fulfill our purpose. Furthermore, part of our purpose requires us to learn. If it wasn\u2019t clear in the previous paragraphs, our essence, our physical body our mind and conscious are intrinsically linked. Therefore, we cannot separate them. We do not have the wrong body or the wrong mind etc. We are all fearfully and wonderfully made and knitted together in our mother\u2019s womb by God specifically to fulfill God\u2019s over arching purpose in a unique way that only each person can fulfill. To decide that any facet of us is not good is the equivalent of thinking that bringing a knife to gunfight is a good decision. At a 3000 foot view, many people exist and they are all trying to fulfill a God imaging purpose as well. Since our purposes all come from God, they must all ultimately work together to fulfill something great and beautiful. Therefore, if in fulfilling your purpose, you counteract the fulfilling of someone else\u2019s purpose, clearly the way you are fulfilling your purpose is incorrect. The same holds if fulfilling one of your purposes counteracts the fulfillment of another of your purposes.","title":"What is existence: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"existence/#what-is-existence-fundamentals-to-christianity","text":"The most obvious aspect of life is that we exist.

Jesus took our place and so now we are not guilty. But let\u2019s talk about this judgment day. Judgement Day is linked to the jewish festival of Rosh Hashanah. This festival is a celebration. Justice is the word mishpat in Hebrew which we have so egregiously misinterpreted. Many only understand justice under the sense of things being made fair. People getting punished for doing wrong. But this is so incomplete. Justice has always been about restoring order, and making things right. Yes punishment is often a part of this. But so is mercy and compassion. God did not destroy the evil assyrians who deserved to be punished because he saw potential in them. He said I believe these people can still do good in this world. But sometimes God does punish. It\u2019s a balance. Many parents recognize the complexity behind it when raising children. However, in Exodus 34, God gives us the ratio 1000:3 compassion to punishment. His judgements are rooted in mercy. Judgement day is about making things right. Believe it or not but this is demonstrated in the first 3 verses of the bible. Elohim the word for God is connected to God being judge. Then we had a formless and void and dark world. This represents chaos. The God said let there be light and began to bring order to chaos. He began making things right. We then brought chaos to order in Genesis 3 and so God has spent the rest of the bible and human history working with us to bring chaos back to order. With this backdrop Let\u2019s talk about two groups of people in second temple Judaism. Pharisees: spoke about last week putting fences around the law so to not break them this is tremendous zeal. This is your psalm 119 love your law idea. Issue not what goes in that defines you but what comes out. Talk about actors. Herodians: subscribe to Judaism but are too absorbed in the pleasures and entertainment of this world. But are able to adapt and interact with culture. Often as new Christians we end up doing one of two things: Either get on this weird cycle where we act like Pharisees we love the law so much. Our zeal encourages us to obey every law. We want to do everything possible to make sure we have followed all his commands. Why? Because that\u2019s what real Christians do right. They take God\u2019s commands seriously. Then we get to this point where we realize we are trying to earn our salvation. We realize that we just can\u2019t obey all these commands. We start to feel distant from God. So we read Ephesians 2:8 and similar. We determine that we need to stop doing works to please God. Therefore, we stop being legalistic and start living in the freedom of Gods victory except with one caveat. We hated our striving for obedience to God\u2019s law that we abandon any law. Our lives look no different than the world. We give in to antinomianism. Then what happens? We end up falling into sin so far that we determine that this is not Christianity. We wonder if we have lost our salvation again and guess what we change back into the cycle of legalism. We read James two and all these commands in the New Testament and determine we aren\u2019t Christians unless we do these things. This cycle continues as we fluctuate between Pharisees and herodians. Each time it gets more subtle and until like too many Christians in America we fall into the negative of the Pharisees and negative of herodians. People who act like we love God and do Christian things but we love the world and are consumed by its pleasures. But the main symptom of this is how do I know if I am saved? How do I know that God sees me as good enough? The other option is we mentally backfile all the seemingly contradictory or complicated scripture and go on with our lives that God saved us. This generally results in a lack of zeal and can often result in looking like herodians. We end up compartmentilizing the Gospel and God\u2019s word and could live contradictory lives. Again the fear is that we look like the bad part of the pharisees and the bad part of the herodians. Let us take a quick deviation. Just before passover every year Pilot recognizing that at Passover most Jews would be in Jerusalem and that it is remembering an event that overthrew the Egyptians, decided that he would go to Jerusalem as well except with an army ready to suppress the Jews. He would ride a white stallion which symbolizes military conquest with an army of soldiers. He would instill fear as the Romans would continue to oppress the Jews. At the same time, Jesus rides in on a donkey with his disciples pronouncing favor and peace. Jesus came to announce his kingdom at the same time pilot was announcing his. This is crazy. And the people wave palm branches symbolizing a revolution. They know exactly what Jesus is doing. Everyone has noticed \u2026 or do they? The next thing Jesus does is cry. Wait what? Why? Well, the Jews had completely missed Jesus\u2019 whole mission. They wanted the wrong kingdom. They wanted revenge on the Romans. Hosanna means Lord, Save us. Jesus did come to save them. But Jesus came to die. This is how he saved us and this is how he wants us to do? You see that entire cycle is completely consumed with self. All it cared about is its own salvation. Did Jesus not do the complete opposite on the cross. He could have saved himself but instead he gave up his life for us. He tells us to take up our cross and follow him Matthew 10:38. Paul says he wishes he could die for others to be saved. Romans 9:1-3. Here is the question. What kingdom do you want? Let\u2019s go back to this day of judgment. Remember purpose is not only to bring retributive justice on the evil people. This is the kingdom that the jews want and sadly this is what substutionary atonement is overly consumed with. We must be punished for wrong doing. But this is not true. 1000:3. This is the day that Jesus returns to make everything right. To bring order to chaos. But that is done by bringing Gods kingdom. This kingdom is about self sacrifice. This is what it looks like for the world to be made right. It is this upside down kingdom. It is this sacrificial love. It is about giving up ourselves for others not us focusing on what saves us. So this is where we get out the court room. We stop focusing on how to get saved and we start focusing on how to save others. There is personal salvation, which we all have for accepting Jesus. But now we leave the court room. The verdict is in. We are justified. But I really want you to broaden your understanding of salvation. There is also global salvation. This should be where our focus should be. Salvation is not just about accepting Jesus as Lord it is about bringing chaos to order. Bringing God\u2019s Kingdom to earth. There is one more thing I want to talk about which is essential. It is this idea of Sabbath. It is that weird commandment in the 10 commandments that we do not understand how it links to today\u2019s world. Sometime I will talk to you about the 10 commandments. Sabbath is more than about rest. It is also about Honoring God. We rest to show that we trust God has control. Sabbath is about letting go. Sabbath is letting the good works you have done be good works. If we don\u2019t do that and keep adding to them, they never become good works because they can never establish relationship. This is complex but important as it is essential to dethroning legalism and fear. Sabbath is saying that what I have done this week is good and now I trust God that he will use it. If we never stop to rest we are not trusting God, we are not giving up control. We are not telling the truth about God that he created this universe and is in control. Ultimately, if we do not stop trying to save ourselves and be a perfect christian by doing all these good works, we rob ourselves of this trusting relationship with God. And look at that if we don\u2019t sabbath, we are making it about ourselves again. We are playing God. We are trying to save ourselves. God has called us to trust in him and focus on others. So get out of the court room, be a living sacrifice for others good and God\u2019s kingdom, and rest in the fact that God is in control and that he is using our good works for his kingdom. Remember his judgements are rooted in mercy.","title":"Getting out of the Court Room: the Antidote to Legalism"},{"location":"legalism/#getting-out-of-the-court-room-the-antidote-to-legalism","text":"We live in the time of the blessing and curse of John Calvin\u2019s prominent substitutionary atonement where the only understanding we seem to have of salvation is with a court room analogy.

It\u2019s a balance. Many parents recognize the complexity behind it when raising children. However, in Exodus 34, God gives us the ratio 1000:3 compassion to punishment. His judgements are rooted in mercy. Judgement day is about making things right. Believe it or not but this is demonstrated in the first 3 verses of the bible. Elohim the word for God is connected to God being judge. Then we had a formless and void and dark world. This represents chaos. The God said let there be light and began to bring order to chaos. He began making things right. We then brought chaos to order in Genesis 3 and so God has spent the rest of the bible and human history working with us to bring chaos back to order. With this backdrop Let\u2019s talk about two groups of people in second temple Judaism. Pharisees: spoke about last week putting fences around the law so to not break them this is tremendous zeal. This is your psalm 119 love your law idea. Issue not what goes in that defines you but what comes out. Talk about actors. Herodians: subscribe to Judaism but are too absorbed in the pleasures and entertainment of this world. But are able to adapt and interact with culture. Often as new Christians we end up doing one of two things: Either get on this weird cycle where we act like Pharisees we love the law so much. Our zeal encourages us to obey every law. We want to do everything possible to make sure we have followed all his commands. Why? Because that\u2019s what real Christians do right. They take God\u2019s commands seriously. Then we get to this point where we realize we are trying to earn our salvation. We realize that we just can\u2019t obey all these commands. We start to feel distant from God. So we read Ephesians 2:8 and similar. We determine that we need to stop doing works to please God. Therefore, we stop being legalistic and start living in the freedom of Gods victory except with one caveat. We hated our striving for obedience to God\u2019s law that we abandon any law. Our lives look no different than the world. We give in to antinomianism. Then what happens? We end up falling into sin so far that we determine that this is not Christianity. We wonder if we have lost our salvation again and guess what we change back into the cycle of legalism. We read James two and all these commands in the New Testament and determine we aren\u2019t Christians unless we do these things. This cycle continues as we fluctuate between Pharisees and herodians. Each time it gets more subtle and until like too many Christians in America we fall into the negative of the Pharisees and negative of herodians. People who act like we love God and do Christian things but we love the world and are consumed by its pleasures. But the main symptom of this is how do I know if I am saved? How do I know that God sees me as good enough? The other option is we mentally backfile all the seemingly contradictory or complicated scripture and go on with our lives that God saved us. This generally results in a lack of zeal and can often result in looking like herodians. We end up compartmentilizing the Gospel and God\u2019s word and could live contradictory lives. Again the fear is that we look like the bad part of the pharisees and the bad part of the herodians. Let us take a quick deviation. Just before passover every year Pilot recognizing that at Passover most Jews would be in Jerusalem and that it is remembering an event that overthrew the Egyptians, decided that he would go to Jerusalem as well except with an army ready to suppress the Jews. He would ride a white stallion which symbolizes military conquest with an army of soldiers. He would instill fear as the Romans would continue to oppress the Jews. At the same time, Jesus rides in on a donkey with his disciples pronouncing favor and peace. Jesus came to announce his kingdom at the same time pilot was announcing his. This is crazy. And the people wave palm branches symbolizing a revolution. They know exactly what Jesus is doing. Everyone has noticed \u2026 or do they? The next thing Jesus does is cry. Wait what? Why? Well, the Jews had completely missed Jesus\u2019 whole mission. They wanted the wrong kingdom. They wanted revenge on the Romans. Hosanna means Lord, Save us. Jesus did come to save them. But Jesus came to die. This is how he saved us and this is how he wants us to do? You see that entire cycle is completely consumed with self. All it cared about is its own salvation. Did Jesus not do the complete opposite on the cross. He could have saved himself but instead he gave up his life for us. He tells us to take up our cross and follow him Matthew 10:38. Paul says he wishes he could die for others to be saved. Romans 9:1-3. Here is the question. What kingdom do you want? Let\u2019s go back to this day of judgment. Remember purpose is not only to bring retributive justice on the evil people. This is the kingdom that the jews want and sadly this is what substutionary atonement is overly consumed with. We must be punished for wrong doing. But this is not true. 1000:3. This is the day that Jesus returns to make everything right. To bring order to chaos. But that is done by bringing Gods kingdom. This kingdom is about self sacrifice. This is what it looks like for the world to be made right. It is this upside down kingdom. It is this sacrificial love. It is about giving up ourselves for others not us focusing on what saves us. So this is where we get out the court room. We stop focusing on how to get saved and we start focusing on how to save others. There is personal salvation, which we all have for accepting Jesus. But now we leave the court room. The verdict is in. We are justified. But I really want you to broaden your understanding of salvation. There is also global salvation. This should be where our focus should be. Salvation is not just about accepting Jesus as Lord it is about bringing chaos to order. Bringing God\u2019s Kingdom to earth. There is one more thing I want to talk about which is essential. It is this idea of Sabbath. It is that weird commandment in the 10 commandments that we do not understand how it links to today\u2019s world. Sometime I will talk to you about the 10 commandments. Sabbath is more than about rest. It is also about Honoring God. We rest to show that we trust God has control. Sabbath is about letting go. Sabbath is letting the good works you have done be good works. If we don\u2019t do that and keep adding to them, they never become good works because they can never establish relationship. This is complex but important as it is essential to dethroning legalism and fear. Sabbath is saying that what I have done this week is good and now I trust God that he will use it. If we never stop to rest we are not trusting God, we are not giving up control. We are not telling the truth about God that he created this universe and is in control. Ultimately, if we do not stop trying to save ourselves and be a perfect christian by doing all these good works, we rob ourselves of this trusting relationship with God. And look at that if we don\u2019t sabbath, we are making it about ourselves again. We are playing God. We are trying to save ourselves. God has called us to trust in him and focus on others. So get out of the court room, be a living sacrifice for others good and God\u2019s kingdom, and rest in the fact that God is in control and that he is using our good works for his kingdom. Remember his judgements are rooted in mercy.","title":"Getting out of the Court Room: the Antidote to Legalism"},{"location":"loveparadox/","text":"Love Paradox Two blogs ago we talked on the meaning of life and how Genesis one and two flow together to bring out our purpose. We spoke about how Genesis two is more important but how we cannot attain that until we have developed enough to be able to properly fulfill our purpose of love and relationships and family which ultimately is just growing of self as we spoke about as well. Then last blog we talked about how this purpose goes wrong as we talked about the fall in Genesis three. Today, I want to talk about some of the complexities of this purpose which believe it or not can be examined in the story of Cain and Abel. It is like God knew what he was doing when he inspired the bible. The other crazy part is that we could do another series on Genesis one through 11 and we could dive deep without even getting into the meaning of life. Genesis is so deep and beautiful. Anyway I digress. Nihilism is a common topic that people talk about in philosophy. Many people argue that life has no meaning and that everything is predetermined and so what is the point. This is on a grand scale, but on a smaller scale it looks far more like what Cain experienced. You may be wandering how this relates. Well, let us think about it. One of the most striking parts of the story with Cain and Abel is that Cain still makes a sacrifice. We like to gloss over the fact that Cain made a sacrifice and presume that it was so bad that he deserved to be punished. Now, if you are Cain after finding out your sacrifice was not good enough what might one of your first thoughts be? Yes, there are many options but one of them might be well why did I even make this sacrifice in the first place? You see in order to make a sacrifice \u2014 even a bad one \u2014 still requires effort. He could have said well I should have not even tried. I would have been in the same place as I am now except I could have had more fun in the past. Is this not the driving factor behind nihilism? That any work we put in now is not worthwhile so what is the point of putting work in in any case. Now you might object and say well Abel\u2019s sacrifice was good enough and you would be absolutely right. I mean two blogs ago we showed what the meaning of life is. But here is the interesting part. Now remember when we read the bible, we need to make sure we are not assuming the bible is missing information. We like to add words to the bible that are not there. One thing that is not there is why Cain\u2019s sacrifice is not good enough. All we know is that God said if he does what is right then he will be accepted. Yet, we still do not really know what he did wrong. In the text it says he gathered some of the fruit while Abel gathered fat portions. (There is clearly a link here between the sacrificial system that I do not yet know enough. More research needed). One important difference though is that Abel brought the first born while Cain did not. Now, if think about this on a metaphorical level, what we see is that Abel gave his best while Cain did not. This is something useful to know but it has a number of complexities. The first one is: if you cannot give your best should we not do it at all? The second is how do we know if we have given our best. The third question could be what if we hit a situation where giving your first born is all you have. I am sure all of you went straight to thinking about Abraham and Issac there. This is exactly what the bible is all about. Taking these major themes and expanding on them. This becomes the crux of life. It is tough to be perfect \u2014 well impossible. This means that we are going to fail and sometimes it is not even our fault. Who knows why Cain did not produce a sacrifice worthy to God? Who knows if he even knew whether it was good enough or not? But is this not exactly where the complexities of life lie. Yes, sin prevents us from living out our purpose and ultimately, that is the reason given in this passage that cost Cain. You see there is no clear evidence in the text that God was even referring to the sacrifice when he said if you do what is right. It just said that God did not look favorably on his sacrifice. I think this is the key. We like to merge these two ideas. but they are two different things. One idea revolves around being accepted. The other idea is about doing a sacrifice. This is an important distinction. You see in life we have two options: we can either take the risk of achieving some purpose in life or we can live Hakuna Matata. I still love how people wear Hakuna Matata shirts when one of the main points of the Lion King was to show that that is not the point of life. It is like they did not see the whole movie. In any case, in the movie Simba is faced with the option, either he continues though life living like there are no worries or he must fulfill his purpose and try take down Scar. Now, I want to emphasize here that this is where the movie can sometimes miss reality by over exaggerating the success rate. How many times have we metaphorically tried to take down Scar and failed. How many times are you willing to try take down Scar before you just decide my Hakuna Matata life was more fun. The crazy part is that either way Timone and Pumba would have accepted Simba. He was not sinning by not taking down Scar but Rafiki (the monkey) did not look favorably on him. It is interesting how we can see two sides of God in Rafiki in that he accepted Simba but also did not look favorably on him. Here is another thought though. How long could Simba have live in Hakuna Matata world until the lack of purpose in his life would have driven him to despair. Well in Cain\u2019s case, not very long. And he even tried to take down Scar. This is the crux. We live in a world where we are trying to find purpose. We cannot find it solely in creating (job and money and power). We are also cannot find it solely in relationships (family friends and community). However, the second is more important at the end of the day. But sometimes we are not able to fulfill that purpose exactly right. This is why the loss of a job, or a broken relationship or rejection is so hurtful. It is why the first impulse we have when this happens is to get a rebound, drink alcohol, eat comfort food and binge Netflix. This is what Nihilism is. It is complete rejection of purpose. You will find that most people who end up shooting up campuses or something similar are people who have been so hurt by the world due to failure to sacrifice effectively enough such that they end up blaming the world and decide that the only solution is to get revenge on the world by causing as much chaos as possible. Starting to sound even more like Cain? The crazy part of the story of Cain and Abel is that after Cain kills Abel, God still shows some love to Cain as he says anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over. What a crazy statement. Why would God care about what happens to Cain? Well, the point of the story comes right here. God Accepts us and loves us regardless of how successful we are but God will use successful people differently. Furthermore, there is absolutely punishment for sin but there is also forgiveness and second chances. The encouragement from God is keep trying but you actually need to put some effort in. You need to try your best. This leaves one issue left to resolve. How do we handle the situations of rejection and failure. How do we handle that pain? The answer I believe is partly answered in Ecclesiastes. There is this weird refrain in the book saying eat drink and be merry. The idea is that, life is hard and does have all these terrible things that may not even be our fault. Therefore, we should eat drink and be merry. But not at the expense of purpose. There is a balance between Hakuna Matata and fulfilling our purpose Another part of it is just a common theme in the bible. When we love people we take a risk. We do not know how it is going to work out. But taking that risk is more important than not. Otherwise, we could never have anything. When God created us he took the risk that we would not choose him. Therefore, we need to risk in the world. We need to love in this world. Yes, it hurts so much much when we face rejection or it fails. But this is where our purpose lies. Either we try to attain our purpose or we spiral into despair. Fundamentally, this life comes down to a simple analogy. How many times can you pick your self up after you fail to try again and achieve your purpose. If we view life in this perspective perhaps we can see failure in a different perspective. In the movie Meet the Robinsons, the family celebrates his success when he fails. Why, because they know the potentiality behind someone who tries. They realize that becoming a Goob or a Cain is the result of not trying. So perhaps our purpose in life has an added layer. Perhaps, our purpose is not just to achieve success in creating and relationships. Perhaps, our purpose has to do with trying to attain that. But when we do not do it well there are consequences and it hurts but at the end of the day is worth celebrating to some degree. And God seems to agree with that to some degree. He asks Cain why he is downcast and why he is angry. It is like God um come on seriously? You just told him he did not do a good job with his sacrifice. It reminds me of when a kid plays a bad soccer match and the parent tells them it was not good enough and then asks why the kid is sad and angry. In some sense it should almost be the opposite. The parent should be happy in some sense that the kid is sad and angry because then it means they took what you said seriously and will probably try harder next time (unless the parent has driven them into despair\u2026 hint hint nudge nudge). If the kid was just happy it would be like the kid did not care. This is the point. Our purpose in life is to try and fail and pick ourselves up again until we succeed. And since life is so complicated and dynamic, this is a whole life learning curve that ultimately teaches us to be better people. In conclusion, eat drink and be merry but don\u2019t fall into despair and do not jeopardize your future while in pain. Unfortunately, that is what Cain did. After a poor sacrifice, Cain\u2019s life was not over. But after he killed Abel, god removed him from his plan and kicked him out the land. Find that balance. But ultimately this is a story asking us to pick ourselves up again and again even when life gets hard. I promise you, if God did not see anymore potential in you he would not let you live. While you are alive, God sees potential in you. (This is not the reason all people die).","title":"Love Paradox"},{"location":"loveparadox/#love-paradox","text":"Two blogs ago we talked on the meaning of life and how Genesis one and two flow together to bring out our purpose.

And since he is outside of time he knew at all instances which includes before the world began. This would imply that God knows who is going to Heaven and hell before we were born. More than that because God created all of us and knows that based on how he created us and organizes and runs the world, he in that sense decided or predetermined or predestined each of us to Heaven or hell. Now, if you read or heard many of my thoughts you would know that the traditional categories of Heaven and hell are not something I believe in. Nevertheless, one could still argue that because of the way God created us and knows everything, he therefore, predetermined us to do every action we do on earth. If we want to be consistent in how we understand predestination, we cannot just limit it to eternal destination. In fact, many predestination believers are willing to let God let us do things on our own choice such as sin (as they would say God could never cause someone to sin). Many of them would say God would let us choose a bunch of things but apparently not whether we want to follow him or not. To me this is a grave misunderstanding of belief. Choosing God or not is the central decision that ultimately affects every other decision we make. This means that choosing God becomes the only real choice we have since everything else is a derivative decision of that choice. In other words, if we cannot choose God (since that was predestined for us to choose or not from the beginning), then there quite simply is no free will. One might say then clearly there is no free will. So many people become stuck on that logic because that logic is so robust. We someone argues that no there is free will because the Bible says so or because it\u2019s not fair or because in life it seems like we do have a choice. But someone with a logical mind using deduction will argue that despite the practicality of the free will argument and it\u2019s appearance to be true, the only possibility is that God must have predetermined our future and decision. This is certainly how my logical mind worked when I was an early Christian who understood the sovereignty of God. However, as I grew older I started to grow away from predestination not because of its seemingly unbeatable logic but because of the practicality of the free will belief and the seeming inconsistencies between the nature of God and his love vs the slavery like predestination. But I still could not beat the predestination sovereignty argument until I came across an idea. What if the first chapter of Genesis gives us insight into the answer? I\u2019m the first chapter God creates all the world but then after creating humans he stops. He does not create us until we are in Heaven (or hell for that matter). He stops after he created us. To me what this implies is that God stopped controlling us after we were created. He let us make our own decisions. You see we often think that absolute power means complete control. However, as we study animals and human empires and the Bible we see that absolute control inevitably fails. Totalitarianism is in fact less powerful than reciprocal altruism. Would it not then be foolish to believe that God who we are made in his image and should follow would do something counter to what is good. Therefore, we see that it is in fact more powerful to limit control and exhibit love through free will. Therefore, I believe that God gives up some of his control in order to let us have free will as that results in a more powerful mode of being for God who by definition lives in the most powerful mode of being which is characterized by love. I have yet to think of a better analogy but this is somewhat analogous to having a test in class and someone giving you the answer sheet such that you could know all the questions and answers of the test and but deciding not to look at it and do the test without knowing the questions. The practical implications of this belief are astounding. First it means that every act we make is dependent on whether we choose God or not. God represents everything that results in the ultimate betterment of ourselves while not choosing God is choosing sin. One can refer to the article on sin which gives more light on this. Now, given that every decision we make is a derivative of those two choices (which by the way is why the Bible constantly encourages us to choose the way of the spirit rather than flesh or choose the way of life rather than death or light than darkness), then the reason we make that choice is based on the hope and goal we have in the future. If we believe that God\u2019s way is the best and that it will mold us and the community into its optimal dynamic state. Therefore, the most important thing to anyone\u2019s belief system is who they want their community which includes themselves to look like as that is the main contributor to how people will act. Many people have desires and hopes and goals that are too small and therefore the decisions they make are often lacking the growth mindset necessary for ultimate joy. In fact, it is often these lesser goals that result in our sinful decisions as we are okay with less than the kingdom of Heaven. Often we are more looking for someone else to bring the kingdom of Heaven to us or expect other to act like the kingdom of Heaven yet are not actually making the effort to make our own lives like the kingdom of Heaven while bringing it to others as well. All of our habits (which I will emphasize the importance of rest) are key to this process as each decision we make, whether it\u2019s cleaning the dishes or getting frustrated a bad driver is part of this process. Some decisions have less of an impact and others more but if we make some decisions with the kingdom of Heaven in mind and others without we will have a life like everyone else but it will result in deficiencies within us and our community. This is by no means a path to a perfect and non suffering life rather a life to fulfillment and a better community. One major complication of this is that all the decisions we make that bring the kingdom of Heaven are not always obvious. Our goal may be to bring it but often we will do things we thought were right but turned out to be wrong. Our belief of the good might not be the true belief of the good. Therefore, we need to live life with humility and a genuine open mind and be willing to get out of our comfort zone in order to understand and experience things we did not before. Now, one of the big things we often fail to understand is the importance of our jobs. What we do when we work is generate productivity in our community and economy this is one thing that benefits everyone. The more money in the system the more money people have. Many Christians have this belief that working a job only fuels greed and is selfish but that is the opposite of what\u2019s true. We should rather be encouraging everyone to work and work hard within a balanced life. The more productive we are in our job the better for the society we live in. Furthermore, our relationships are important we should not jeopardize friendships or family or significant others by working too hard. We should ensure we are balanced in that. Balance is incredibly key and is something that we have to figure out as we move on in life. When should I focus more on work and when should I focus more on relationships. This should be done without jeopardizing the future of either. Therefore, we can break a lot of life decisions around those two principles. Is what we are doing helping us to be more productive or is it being generous within our relationships. Focusing on the immediate people and things around us in this case seems more important. Therefore, focusing on our work ethic and desire to learn and training our dopamine cycle to reward us after doing good workin order to encourage ourselves to be productive as well as treating our family members and close friends with kindness and helping them and bearing with them wherever necessary. As we train ourselves to treat these people well we will see them treat us well back and create a happier core community. We will also see us treat people we don\u2019t know or are not part of our life very much better as we are carving who we are into our nature. If we do these things in combination with appropriate rest we can start to see ourselves become a person we love. Our confidence will grow and our vision of who we can be will grow. This in term will encourage us to be an even better person and we will create an upward spiral of bringing the kingdom of God. Often in life bad things will happen. This can be due to our own mistakes or ignorance or others or bad luck and the sad realities of life. These times are stressful and they encourage us to turn our attention over to how bad our own life is. This process of focusing on how unlucky we are etc is the most destructive part about the trial. The reason for this is because it can cause us to feel nihilistic and hopeless. Whether it\u2019s because we put in work and it didn\u2019t result in what we wanted or whether it was because we were doing or these good things and bad luck in life crushed of the work that was done. These things make us wonder why we even tried. Why was it worth being a better person and bringing the kingdom of Heaven if the world would destroy it anyway. There is no doubt that these times are hard and that people should do a better job of comforting us and bearing with us but the Bible gives a solution to this that is mind blowing. It says in the midst of suffering we should focus others. In 2 Corinthians 8 vs 1-2 it says: \u201cWe want you to know, brothers, about the grace of God that has been given among the churches of Macedonia, for in a severe test of affliction, their abundance of joy and their extreme poverty have overflowed in a wealth of generosity on their part.\u201d The answer is not in shutting down and feeling sorry for ourselves but rather in continuing to persevere in our productivity and generosity. In fact, when we are here this stress or hard time, it is when our true colors come out and we see how well we have truly trained ourselves to bring the kingdom of Heaven. Any shortcomings we have we should be humble about them and learn from them and continue to aim high at who we should be in those times. The next practical implication of choice and God sacrificing his own control gives us a glimpse at what totalitarianism is. Giving people choice is one of the most important aspects of love. In fact, when truth is freely chosen and comes into existence, that is epitome of love. Life often seems easier when we are able to force people to do things. When that happens we know the result. But when we give them a choice to do something or not we do not know the result and often we will not like it. That is why it is easier for us to try and force someone to do something. We do this more often than we think. Whenever we manipulate someone of abuse them we are treating them as objects for our own personal gain without their true consent. True consent is important as it may be the best option to a slave when the other option may be death due to being kicked out. History and evolution has shown us time and time again that this doesn\u2019t work. These smokers/businesses/regimes or friendships etc never last long and eventually fail. This is why if God was like this he would be self defeating. He would be doing something less than optimal. This is why if we give up control over others we will see genuine friendships and joy. This is what God wanted with us. Therefore, if he controlled our salvation how would there be any genuineness in our relationship with him for either a psychological or spiritual sense. If he controlled our salvation then how can we hope for the kingdom of Heaven when there is nothing genuine in our allegiance to this optimal state. It would be easier to see that we are being manipulated for God\u2019s personal benefit. Many predestinationists believe we live in an illusion of choice. This would be like saying it\u2019s okay to manipulate someone into giving you consent since they did not really freely choose it. God is not someone who manipulates. He is not a totalitarian. He is not out for solely his own desires. He wants ultimate joy for everyone and that is only available when we freely choose the ultimate truth which is God and his Kingdom.","title":"Predestination and Free Will"},{"location":"predestination_free_will/#my-opinion-on-the-predestination-free-will-issue","text":"To over simplify the two opinions, predestination originates out of the idea that God has to be sovereign and all powerful and all knowing. And since he is outside of time he knew at all instances which includes before the world began. This would imply that God knows who is going to Heaven and hell before we were born. More than that because God created all of us and knows that based on how he created us and organizes and runs the world, he in that sense decided or predetermined or predestined each of us to Heaven or hell. Now, if you read or heard many of my thoughts you would know that the traditional categories of Heaven and hell are not something I believe in. Nevertheless, one could still argue that because of the way God created us and knows everything, he therefore, predetermined us to do every action we do on earth. If we want to be consistent in how we understand predestination, we cannot just limit it to eternal destination. In fact, many predestination believers are willing to let God let us do things on our own choice such as sin (as they would say God could never cause someone to sin). Many of them would say God would let us choose a bunch of things but apparently not whether we want to follow him or not. To me this is a grave misunderstanding of belief. Choosing God or not is the central decision that ultimately affects every other decision we make. This means that choosing God becomes the only real choice we have since everything else is a derivative decision of that choice. In other words, if we cannot choose God (since that was predestined for us to choose or not from the beginning), then there quite simply is no free will. One might say then clearly there is no free will. So many people become stuck on that logic because that logic is so robust. We someone argues that no there is free will because the Bible says so or because it\u2019s not fair or because in life it seems like we do have a choice. But someone with a logical mind using deduction will argue that despite the practicality of the free will argument and it\u2019s appearance to be true, the only possibility is that God must have predetermined our future and decision. This is certainly how my logical mind worked when I was an early Christian who understood the sovereignty of God. However, as I grew older I started to grow away from predestination not because of its seemingly unbeatable logic but because of the practicality of the free will belief and the seeming inconsistencies between the nature of God and his love vs the slavery like predestination. But I still could not beat the predestination sovereignty argument until I came across an idea. What if the first chapter of Genesis gives us insight into the answer? I\u2019m the first chapter God creates all the world but then after creating humans he stops. He does not create us until we are in Heaven (or hell for that matter). He stops after he created us. To me what this implies is that God stopped controlling us after we were created. He let us make our own decisions. You see we often think that absolute power means complete control. However, as we study animals and human empires and the Bible we see that absolute control inevitably fails. Totalitarianism is in fact less powerful than reciprocal altruism. Would it not then be foolish to believe that God who we are made in his image and should follow would do something counter to what is good. Therefore, we see that it is in fact more powerful to limit control and exhibit love through free will. Therefore, I believe that God gives up some of his control in order to let us have free will as that results in a more powerful mode of being for God who by definition lives in the most powerful mode of being which is characterized by love. I have yet to think of a better analogy but this is somewhat analogous to having a test in class and someone giving you the answer sheet such that you could know all the questions and answers of the test and but deciding not to look at it and do the test without knowing the questions. The practical implications of this belief are astounding. First it means that every act we make is dependent on whether we choose God or not. God represents everything that results in the ultimate betterment of ourselves while not choosing God is choosing sin. One can refer to the article on sin which gives more light on this. Now, given that every decision we make is a derivative of those two choices (which by the way is why the Bible constantly encourages us to choose the way of the spirit rather than flesh or choose the way of life rather than death or light than darkness), then the reason we make that choice is based on the hope and goal we have in the future. If we believe that God\u2019s way is the best and that it will mold us and the community into its optimal dynamic state. Therefore, the most important thing to anyone\u2019s belief system is who they want their community which includes themselves to look like as that is the main contributor to how people will act. Many people have desires and hopes and goals that are too small and therefore the decisions they make are often lacking the growth mindset necessary for ultimate joy. In fact, it is often these lesser goals that result in our sinful decisions as we are okay with less than the kingdom of Heaven. Often we are more looking for someone else to bring the kingdom of Heaven to us or expect other to act like the kingdom of Heaven yet are not actually making the effort to make our own lives like the kingdom of Heaven while bringing it to others as well. All of our habits (which I will emphasize the importance of rest) are key to this process as each decision we make, whether it\u2019s cleaning the dishes or getting frustrated a bad driver is part of this process. Some decisions have less of an impact and others more but if we make some decisions with the kingdom of Heaven in mind and others without we will have a life like everyone else but it will result in deficiencies within us and our community. This is by no means a path to a perfect and non suffering life rather a life to fulfillment and a better community.

Many people view sin in a static sense where there are a list of dos and don'ts (especially don'ts) that need to be followed otherwise we sin. This I would argue is very inaccurate. The most accurate defenition based on how the israelites used it was to miss the mark. We can imagine an archer shooting at the target and if he does not get bullseye, then he missed the market and in some sense sinned. Now, many people know that but not many see the gravity of that statement. We think that well to miss the mark would be the same as not following one of those dos or don'ts. That I think misses out on what missing the mark truly is. Many people have philosophized what the perfect human might be and how do you get there. Christains argue that that person existed and his name is Jesus. Would it not be more appropriate to say that to miss the mark would be to do anything that inhibits us from looking like Jesus or that perfect person. This to me is a far better way we can contextulize sin. Is what we are doing preventing us from being the best possible person. Then to become better at that would be sanctification. Now there are a couple of things to discuss here that need to be fleshed out further. First, what does a perfect person look like. Second, how do rules in the bible relate to helping us to become that especially at different levels of maturity. Thirdly, are their derivative sins of higher order and how do we handle those situations. Many chirstians recognize that Jesus was the perfect person but from the way they red the bible the think Jesus was simply a rule following scripture knowing hpyer compassionate and caring person. Although, none of this is wrong, it is very incomplete. I have watched many pastors or highly religious christain parents raise there kids exactly like I defined above. But so often these kids end up angry or resentful at christianity. Many of these kids are weak and easily stepped on and have a very narrow worldview. Let us go through some of what the bible defines as a perfect person and look at how Jesus mirrored it. The way the bible is set up is that Genesis 1-12 is the building block and stage setter for everything else that comes in the bible and it is difficult to find a theme in the bible that is not ultimately rooted in the first 12 chapters. The first chapter teaches us about the fact that we cannot control everything and that rest is a good thing and that being productive and using the skills we were given is a good thing. the second chapter teaches us to enjoy the world we are given but be thankful. It also teaches us that relationships are paramount and that vulnerability and generosity is a key to the joy of the relationship. The third chapter teaches us that we do not get to choose how the world works and what we think is right or wrong rather these things are already in place. Our desires are not good thermometers for morality. It also expounds on how when we choose our desires over true good given by God, it results in our own corruption and objectification of others indicating that God's way of setting up the world is the objective true and best way. Chapter 4 talks about the imporantance of sacrifice and the consequences of an insufficient sacrifice. It points to the necessity of adventure and failure and how to get out of our comfort zone to grow. It teaches about forgiving yourself and having the humility to recognize we can do better. It also teaches that if we are not willing to take risks we will never grow into great people and that rather that those who do not tke risks will become resentful and will seek to cause pain, suffering and death to the innocent. In chapter 6 we are taught to always be prepared for the suffering and hard times and that these things are a fact of life. It teaches about having a plan for the future and having faith that sacrificing instant gratification can result in us not getting destroyed by the inevitable calamities in this world. It also teaches about having patience. Chapter 7 and 8 teaches us that like in chapter 1 that we should give up trying to control everything. Chapter 1 is about trying to control over creating everything good while chapter 7 and 8 is about trying to control destroying everything that is bad. There are limits on these things. We are taught to have mercy. We are taught not try and control everything people do as that is objectification. Rather we should trust in each other even if people cannot do things as well as we can or do not want to do things the way we want. Chapter 9 teaches us about boundaires. Too much vulnerability to some people can be destructive. It further teaches about mercy and how to not let our anger go too far. It teaches that instead we should forgive. The first half Chapter 11 teaches about not being selfish and the second half teaches us to be selfless to make other peoples name great not ours. It teaches us to bring these good traits we have spoken about to earth and to others and not to run away and create a pseudo utopia in which we think everything will be perfect under our rationlization. Finally, in chapter 12 with all these ideas in mind God calls us out into adventure. He calls us away from the safety of our own comforts and towards the unknown asking us to have faith that going through a difficult period and taking risks will make us better. What we see from this is not a picture of rules to follow but rather about molding ourselves into a competent mature interconnected individual that can take on the world and anything that is thrown at them while still caring about other people making their name great and not objectifying them. As I look at Jesus' Story more closely this is exactly what I see. Jesus undertook an adventure away from his familiy and despite what the world threw at him he was prepared and cared for others in the process. He never manipulated or used someone for his persnal gain and was prepared to sacrifice for others all the time. He never blamed anyone instead he forgave and took the burden of their (and our) sin on him. This is true sacrifice. It genuinely cost him something when he sacrificed and that was not just on the cross. This is in contrast to Cain and in line with Abel in Genesis 4. These are the charactersitics of a perfect person and this is the type of person we should be aspiring to be. To sin would be live in a way that would go against becoming this person. Now, we look to the second question. Why are there so many rules in the bible. Are we not supposed to follow all of them? Were the Jews not supposed to follow all of them? This is where we need to view the bible and civilation as a whole as a teaching for people from the ground up. If the bible just said you should love God first and then love others as yourself, would that be enough. I personally believe that everything outlined in Genesis 1-12 (in fact the rest of the bible) on how to live is a derivative of that statement. So then why is the bible so much longer? Well, how do love? what does it look like. Love is so complex and layered. It is not easily undertood except through complex explanation. I personally think love is so complicated that we cannot exaplin it merely through a sophisticated technical essay but rather need stories tohighlight the nuances and intricacies that are part of it in everyday life in a corrupt and fallen world. This is why studying the bible is so helpful as it does an amazing job of highlighting so many of these intricacies and explain in depth how to handle complicated situations with love or the right way. One fact is that sometimes there may be many right ways but that balance is a key component. When parents are teaching young kids how to behave appropriately in society, they are often unable to explain exactly why their kids are not allowed to do certain things are why they force their kids to do certain things to the kids and often have say something like because I sad so and I make the rules. This is becasue the explanation is too technical and difficult for the kid to properly grasp. There are probably better ways to handle the situation above but the point remains that at an early age parts of morality are difficult to understand. This is exactly why God tried to make it as simple as possible to follow his rules that he gave the israelites in Exodus and Leviticus. He told them what to do and say and in some sense restricted their freedom immensely. But I believe this is necessary and the right way to slowly teach an individual, a community and ultimately the world how to live correctly morally. We need to remember that most people in their time are not educated and so having simple rules to follow that pointed in the direction of love is the most helpful thing God could do. The rules He set were often images of how to live and pointed people in the right direction. I am not going to get into the nitty gritty of trying to show what each law represents or why it is there especially because I do not know all of it. But the laws given to the Israelites are similar to the idea of not letting your kid play near the street. There is nothing wrong with playing by the street but since a kid does not know better it could result in a catastrophic disaster. This is necessary I believe even nowadays for people who are new converts who do not understand the subtleties of love. They might need additional rules or restrictions so that they do not do something that goes against helping them become that best person. It is worth noting to further emphasize the above point that it is not easy to stop doing something that worked counter to you becoming the best version of yourself. This is why protection at young age or ignorant age is important. You may not properly understand why what you are doing it wrong but if you keep doing it only to discover later that it was wrong, it can be firstly very difficult to reverse and there may be other consequences it caused that are hard to reverse. Portnography in children would be one of the obvious horrors. Many kids do not understand the subtle objectification they are teaching themselves on how to treat women and also do not understand the mental side effects particulary on focus and anxiety that it causes. But when they do realize, a lot of damage is already done. Again protection is good and that is why at a younf or ignorant age we should trust those wiser than us. However, as we get older, sin does not become not doing these protective laws rather it morphs into something way more complicated as we are now tasked with making the difficult decision of what to do when our parents are not there to give us protective laws. We are encouraged to be mature and to face the unknown. We use the biblical laws given in their specific context to help usto understand how to love God, others and ourselves correctly. It is much more complicated but that is why we need to grow up. Asking questions like is it wrong to drink or to hang out with these people no longer has a simple answer like it did when were young and ignorant because there is nothing inherently wrong with drinking or hanging out with anybody. The better question now becomes, is this helping me become the best version of myself. And this question is not purely selfish either because as we spoke about earlier, the best version of ourself involves generosity. It involves caring for people and not objectifying people. It involves inviting in but it also involves have boundaries. We see that sin is much more complicated as the right answer to many of these sitations is not clear. In some sense both decisions could be right. Yes, there are some things that regardless of the situation are not right like rape and murder. But even then with murder, is it murder to leave your wounded friend out on the battlefield to die because carrying him might result in the death of you and two others? The trolley cart dillemma also points out the complexities of morality. The trolley cart scenario asks the question, if you were on a train that did not have breaks and there were three people on the track and it was guarenteed that the cart would kill all three if it hit them unless you pull this lever that takes the cart onto another set of rails that is guarenteed to kill one person. Do you pull the lever? There are many iterations of this scenario -- you can look them up but the idea is that life is complicated. Sometimes there are no right answers and sometimes there are no wrong answers and perhaps it is about trying to make the best of each situation. It is about molding ourselves into the best version of ourselves. But as we have established this is difficult to do without taking risks and going into the unknown and failing. This adds another complex aspect to life. If sin is missing the mark how is it good for us to fail. Is that not simply missing the mark? This again shows how we cannot define sin as single events so easily although they defeintely can be singular events. Rather sin appears to be aligned with the desires of the heart. Who do we want to become and do we really want it? Or are the hedonistic pleasures of this world and lazy cowardice too tempting. I believe God is inviting us towards the former statemnt and awy from the later and that is truly follwoing God. This is what we are saying when we say we believe in God. Finally, we look at the heirarchical structure of morality. Like i mentioned earlier, eveything good we can do on this earth is loving. That includes adventure and failure. However, there are some ways in which we can miss the mark that are worse than others and some derivatives are less important than others. Let us start with this analogy. Imagine it is the second world war and you live in Nazi Germany and are currently hiding some Jewish people in your house from the authorities. The authorities come knocking on your door asking if any Jews are staying in your house. Do you lie and say no or tell the truth and say yes. I think quite obviously the right answer is to lie and say no. Which is weird because had you not lied, then purely from a rule following point of view, you would not have sinned, but lying clearly is a sin. To me this is another instance where sin is not so obviously a singular event and sin also does not only correspond to how it effects you. This world is corrupt and often we are asked to make choices that do not have clear morally correct answers. Instead we are asked to find the ultimate source of who we are trying to become and aim for that. Do we want to be someone who stands up for what is right and the rights of others while compassionately sacrificing our potential future for the goodness of the marginalized or do we will want to cower in fear at the tryannical oppression and evil regimes of this world. This is why it is so obvious that lying is the right thing. It is not the right time to stand up against the authorities and say yes but you cannot have them because it is wrong as that would be negligent and would probably not be successful although noble. Again, we see how life is complicated. What this should also open our eyes to see is that because life is complicated we are going to make mistakes even when we were not trying to or did not do on purpose. We often make terrible mistakes ignorantly while trying to do good. Therefore, we need to be able to forgive ourselves and accept the forgiveness that God has offered otherwise, we will be kept down by our own guilt. The final thing I want to talk about is whether different sins have different or the same consequences. Many christians have been told that any sin is enough to have us fall short of God's glory and is why we need Jesus to save us. While this is not wrong, it completely misses the point of sin. We will not get to heaven and be perfect and complete. If so heaven would be boring. The greatest joy in this world is not found in static pleasure such as drinking margaritas on the beach three steps away from my luxury mansion. This becomes boring very quickly and we all know boredom is a form of hell on earth. It is easy to imagine times as a kid when I had vacation periods and could do anything I wanted to do almost every day of the school year involving play some level of video game, watch tv and not work. Yet, after doing that for a while despite how amazing I thought it was during classes, suddenly became boring and life suddenly was not fun. Everyone can relate to this to some degree. It shows how a static heaven would not be heaven. True happiness is found on this earth by doing something meaningful and growing into a greater person. This is definitely going to be a big part of heaven. How that will look especially if evil will cease to exist, I have no idea. But a dynamic adventurous and meaningful life is what brings the most joy to us. Understanding this, sheds light on why hyper sancitification upon death does not make sense and why sancification in general is so important. Some things are simply hared to unlearn and then learn the right way than others. Furthermore, we need to view sin not solely as something that only affects us but also has something that affects the whol community around us. Therefore, some things we do (which definitely includes our way of life) cause more choas and suffering than others and are more difficult to rectify. Since the ultimate goal is not just complete santification of ourself but complete santification for all, it is clear that some sins are worse than others. In conclusion, what we showed is that sin can be singular event, a way of life and it effects the whole community. We also saw that the goal is be the best version of ourselves but that the best version of ourselves has the goal of making everyone else the best version of themselves (which is not done via control and force but by love). Therefore, we cannot be the best version of ourselves unless everyone is as well. However, if there was a best version of ourself that we could become, that would result in a static ending which be boring. Therefore, we get to infintely pursue perfection which itself is perfection and is God. And there is nothing truly more glorious than that. That, ultimately, is why we should not sin.","title":"Sin"},{"location":"sin/#sin","text":"There are many misconceptions about sin throughout the world and even within the christian faith. Many people view sin in a static sense where there are a list of dos and don'ts (especially don'ts) that need to be followed otherwise we sin. This I would argue is very inaccurate. The most accurate defenition based on how the israelites used it was to miss the mark. We can imagine an archer shooting at the target and if he does not get bullseye, then he missed the market and in some sense sinned. Now, many people know that but not many see the gravity of that statement. We think that well to miss the mark would be the same as not following one of those dos or don'ts. That I think misses out on what missing the mark truly is. Many people have philosophized what the perfect human might be and how do you get there. Christains argue that that person existed and his name is Jesus. Would it not be more appropriate to say that to miss the mark would be to do anything that inhibits us from looking like Jesus or that perfect person. This to me is a far better way we can contextulize sin. Is what we are doing preventing us from being the best possible person. Then to become better at that would be sanctification. Now there are a couple of things to discuss here that need to be fleshed out further. First, what does a perfect person look like. Second, how do rules in the bible relate to helping us to become that especially at different levels of maturity. Thirdly, are their derivative sins of higher order and how do we handle those situations. Many chirstians recognize that Jesus was the perfect person but from the way they red the bible the think Jesus was simply a rule following scripture knowing hpyer compassionate and caring person. Although, none of this is wrong, it is very incomplete. I have watched many pastors or highly religious christain parents raise there kids exactly like I defined above. But so often these kids end up angry or resentful at christianity. Many of these kids are weak and easily stepped on and have a very narrow worldview. Let us go through some of what the bible defines as a perfect person and look at how Jesus mirrored it. The way the bible is set up is that Genesis 1-12 is the building block and stage setter for everything else that comes in the bible and it is difficult to find a theme in the bible that is not ultimately rooted in the first 12 chapters. The first chapter teaches us about the fact that we cannot control everything and that rest is a good thing and that being productive and using the skills we were given is a good thing. the second chapter teaches us to enjoy the world we are given but be thankful. It also teaches us that relationships are paramount and that vulnerability and generosity is a key to the joy of the relationship. The third chapter teaches us that we do not get to choose how the world works and what we think is right or wrong rather these things are already in place. Our desires are not good thermometers for morality. It also expounds on how when we choose our desires over true good given by God, it results in our own corruption and objectification of others indicating that God's way of setting up the world is the objective true and best way. Chapter 4 talks about the imporantance of sacrifice and the consequences of an insufficient sacrifice. It points to the necessity of adventure and failure and how to get out of our comfort zone to grow. It teaches about forgiving yourself and having the humility to recognize we can do better. It also teaches that if we are not willing to take risks we will never grow into great people and that rather that those who do not tke risks will become resentful and will seek to cause pain, suffering and death to the innocent. In chapter 6 we are taught to always be prepared for the suffering and hard times and that these things are a fact of life. It teaches about having a plan for the future and having faith that sacrificing instant gratification can result in us not getting destroyed by the inevitable calamities in this world. It also teaches about having patience. Chapter 7 and 8 teaches us that like in chapter 1 that we should give up trying to control everything. Chapter 1 is about trying to control over creating everything good while chapter 7 and 8 is about trying to control destroying everything that is bad. There are limits on these things. We are taught to have mercy. We are taught not try and control everything people do as that is objectification. Rather we should trust in each other even if people cannot do things as well as we can or do not want to do things the way we want. Chapter 9 teaches us about boundaires. Too much vulnerability to some people can be destructive. It further teaches about mercy and how to not let our anger go too far. It teaches that instead we should forgive. The first half Chapter 11 teaches about not being selfish and the second half teaches us to be selfless to make other peoples name great not ours. It teaches us to bring these good traits we have spoken about to earth and to others and not to run away and create a pseudo utopia in which we think everything will be perfect under our rationlization. Finally, in chapter 12 with all these ideas in mind God calls us out into adventure. He calls us away from the safety of our own comforts and towards the unknown asking us to have faith that going through a difficult period and taking risks will make us better. What we see from this is not a picture of rules to follow but rather about molding ourselves into a competent mature interconnected individual that can take on the world and anything that is thrown at them while still caring about other people making their name great and not objectifying them. As I look at Jesus' Story more closely this is exactly what I see. Jesus undertook an adventure away from his familiy and despite what the world threw at him he was prepared and cared for others in the process. He never manipulated or used someone for his persnal gain and was prepared to sacrifice for others all the time. He never blamed anyone instead he forgave and took the burden of their (and our) sin on him. This is true sacrifice. It genuinely cost him something when he sacrificed and that was not just on the cross. This is in contrast to Cain and in line with Abel in Genesis 4. These are the charactersitics of a perfect person and this is the type of person we should be aspiring to be. To sin would be live in a way that would go against becoming this person. Now, we look to the second question. Why are there so many rules in the bible. Are we not supposed to follow all of them? Were the Jews not supposed to follow all of them? This is where we need to view the bible and civilation as a whole as a teaching for people from the ground up. If the bible just said you should love God first and then love others as yourself, would that be enough. I personally believe that everything outlined in Genesis 1-12 (in fact the rest of the bible) on how to live is a derivative of that statement. So then why is the bible so much longer? Well, how do love? what does it look like. Love is so complex and layered. It is not easily undertood except through complex explanation. I personally think love is so complicated that we cannot exaplin it merely through a sophisticated technical essay but rather need stories tohighlight the nuances and intricacies that are part of it in everyday life in a corrupt and fallen world. This is why studying the bible is so helpful as it does an amazing job of highlighting so many of these intricacies and explain in depth how to handle complicated situations with love or the right way. One fact is that sometimes there may be many right ways but that balance is a key component. When parents are teaching young kids how to behave appropriately in society, they are often unable to explain exactly why their kids are not allowed to do certain things are why they force their kids to do certain things to the kids and often have say something like because I sad so and I make the rules. This is becasue the explanation is too technical and difficult for the kid to properly grasp. There are probably better ways to handle the situation above but the point remains that at an early age parts of morality are difficult to understand. This is exactly why God tried to make it as simple as possible to follow his rules that he gave the israelites in Exodus and Leviticus. He told them what to do and say and in some sense restricted their freedom immensely. But I believe this is necessary and the right way to slowly teach an individual, a community and ultimately the world how to live correctly morally. We need to remember that most people in their time are not educated and so having simple rules to follow that pointed in the direction of love is the most helpful thing God could do. The rules He set were often images of how to live and pointed people in the right direction. I am not going to get into the nitty gritty of trying to show what each law represents or why it is there especially because I do not know all of it. But the laws given to the Israelites are similar to the idea of not letting your kid play near the street. There is nothing wrong with playing by the street but since a kid does not know better it could result in a catastrophic disaster. This is necessary I believe even nowadays for people who are new converts who do not understand the subtleties of love. They might need additional rules or restrictions so that they do not do something that goes against helping them become that best person. It is worth noting to further emphasize the above point that it is not easy to stop doing something that worked counter to you becoming the best version of yourself. This is why protection at young age or ignorant age is important. You may not properly understand why what you are doing it wrong but if you keep doing it only to discover later that it was wrong, it can be firstly very difficult to reverse and there may be other consequences it caused that are hard to reverse. Portnography in children would be one of the obvious horrors. Many kids do not understand the subtle objectification they are teaching themselves on how to treat women and also do not understand the mental side effects particulary on focus and anxiety that it causes. But when they do realize, a lot of damage is already done. Again protection is good and that is why at a younf or ignorant age we should trust those wiser than us. However, as we get older, sin does not become not doing these protective laws rather it morphs into something way more complicated as we are now tasked with making the difficult decision of what to do when our parents are not there to give us protective laws. We are encouraged to be mature and to face the unknown. We use the biblical laws given in their specific context to help usto understand how to love God, others and ourselves correctly. It is much more complicated but that is why we need to grow up. Asking questions like is it wrong to drink or to hang out with these people no longer has a simple answer like it did when were young and ignorant because there is nothing inherently wrong with drinking or hanging out with anybody. The better question now becomes, is this helping me become the best version of myself. And this question is not purely selfish either because as we spoke about earlier, the best version of ourself involves generosity. It involves caring for people and not objectifying people. It involves inviting in but it also involves have boundaries. We see that sin is much more complicated as the right answer to many of these sitations is not clear. In some sense both decisions could be right. Yes, there are some things that regardless of the situation are not right like rape and murder. But even then with murder, is it murder to leave your wounded friend out on the battlefield to die because carrying him might result in the death of you and two others? The trolley cart dillemma also points out the complexities of morality. The trolley cart scenario asks the question, if you were on a train that did not have breaks and there were three people on the track and it was guarenteed that the cart would kill all three if it hit them unless you pull this lever that takes the cart onto another set of rails that is guarenteed to kill one person. Do you pull the lever? There are many iterations of this scenario -- you can look them up but the idea is that life is complicated. Sometimes there are no right answers and sometimes there are no wrong answers and perhaps it is about trying to make the best of each situation. It is about molding ourselves into the best version of ourselves. But as we have established this is difficult to do without taking risks and going into the unknown and failing. This adds another complex aspect to life. If sin is missing the mark how is it good for us to fail. Is that not simply missing the mark? This again shows how we cannot define sin as single events so easily although they defeintely can be singular events. Rather sin appears to be aligned with the desires of the heart. Who do we want to become and do we really want it? Or are the hedonistic pleasures of this world and lazy cowardice too tempting. I believe God is inviting us towards the former statemnt and awy from the later and that is truly follwoing God. This is what we are saying when we say we believe in God. Finally, we look at the heirarchical structure of morality. Like i mentioned earlier, eveything good we can do on this earth is loving. That includes adventure and failure. However, there are some ways in which we can miss the mark that are worse than others and some derivatives are less important than others. Let us start with this analogy. Imagine it is the second world war and you live in Nazi Germany and are currently hiding some Jewish people in your house from the authorities. The authorities come knocking on your door asking if any Jews are staying in your house. Do you lie and say no or tell the truth and say yes. I think quite obviously the right answer is to lie and say no. Which is weird because had you not lied, then purely from a rule following point of view, you would not have sinned, but lying clearly is a sin. To me this is another instance where sin is not so obviously a singular event and sin also does not only correspond to how it effects you. This world is corrupt and often we are asked to make choices that do not have clear morally correct answers. Instead we are asked to find the ultimate source of who we are trying to become and aim for that. Do we want to be someone who stands up for what is right and the rights of others while compassionately sacrificing our potential future for the goodness of the marginalized or do we will want to cower in fear at the tryannical oppression and evil regimes of this world. This is why it is so obvious that lying is the right thing. It is not the right time to stand up against the authorities and say yes but you cannot have them because it is wrong as that would be negligent and would probably not be successful although noble. Again, we see how life is complicated. What this should also open our eyes to see is that because life is complicated we are going to make mistakes even when we were not trying to or did not do on purpose. We often make terrible mistakes ignorantly while trying to do good. Therefore, we need to be able to forgive ourselves and accept the forgiveness that God has offered otherwise, we will be kept down by our own guilt. The final thing I want to talk about is whether different sins have different or the same consequences. Many christians have been told that any sin is enough to have us fall short of God's glory and is why we need Jesus to save us. While this is not wrong, it completely misses the point of sin. We will not get to heaven and be perfect and complete. If so heaven would be boring. The greatest joy in this world is not found in static pleasure such as drinking margaritas on the beach three steps away from my luxury mansion. This becomes boring very quickly and we all know boredom is a form of hell on earth. It is easy to imagine times as a kid when I had vacation periods and could do anything I wanted to do almost every day of the school year involving play some level of video game, watch tv and not work. Yet, after doing that for a while despite how amazing I thought it was during classes, suddenly became boring and life suddenly was not fun. Everyone can relate to this to some degree. It shows how a static heaven would not be heaven. True happiness is found on this earth by doing something meaningful and growing into a greater person. This is definitely going to be a big part of heaven. How that will look especially if evil will cease to exist, I have no idea. But a dynamic adventurous and meaningful life is what brings the most joy to us. Understanding this, sheds light on why hyper sancitification upon death does not make sense and why sancification in general is so important. Some things are simply hared to unlearn and then learn the right way than others. Furthermore, we need to view sin not solely as something that only affects us but also has something that affects the whol community around us. Therefore, some things we do (which definitely includes our way of life) cause more choas and suffering than others and are more difficult to rectify. Since the ultimate goal is not just complete santification of ourself but complete santification for all, it is clear that some sins are worse than others. In conclusion, what we showed is that sin can be singular event, a way of life and it effects the whole community. We also saw that the goal is be the best version of ourselves but that the best version of ourselves has the goal of making everyone else the best version of themselves (which is not done via control and force but by love). Therefore, we cannot be the best version of ourselves unless everyone is as well. However, if there was a best version of ourself that we could become, that would result in a static ending which be boring. Therefore, we get to infintely pursue perfection which itself is perfection and is God. And there is nothing truly more glorious than that. That, ultimately, is why we should not sin.","title":"Sin"},{"location":"truth/","text":"What is Truth: Fundamentals to Christianity Truth is a topic that many debate in our current age. Many are happy to uphold a historical, scientific or Mathematics concept of truth that holds for all times and places in the correct sense. But when it comes to theological, moral or philosophical truth, for some reason this idea seems to be no longer relevant. For example, we are happy to state that gravity exists throughout the world regardless of whether you believe it is there or not. We are happy to state that 7+12=19. We are happy to state that 9/11 happened in 2001. We state these as matters of truth. Anyone who does not believe in these things we (at least in our mind) think they are just simply incorrect. If these questions were asked in a test at school, if you said gravity does not exist, 7+12 =14 or 9/11 did not happen you would be marked incorrect and no one would bat an eye. This is important. If these answers could have been marked either correct or incorrect then we have an issue because we would not be able to trust anything. Imagine going through life and receiving an income and not knowing how much that will add to your saving/checking account. Imagine going through life not knowing whether gravity will work or not and potentially just start floating. Imagine going through life not knowing whether what you remember happened yesterday (or in the past in general) actually happened. Life simply would not work. It would be complete chaos. Therefore, truth in its simplest definition is what brings order to chaos. Truth allows us to know that things on this earth are reliable and trustworthy. This brings us to the current post modern dilemma. If truth is necessary for us to make sense of how we live in this world based on history, science and mathematics, what about theology, morality and philosophy. Is it possible to have two contradicting moral codes true at the same time? The answer to this has to be no, however, there is a nuance to it that we will talk about later. If this is the case, then how do you determine whether someone is guilty or not. To put it blankly, if person A thinks murder is a good thing while person B thinks murder is wrong, how do you determine if person B is guilty if they kill someone. Do we just say its okay to murder so that we do not infringe on person B\u2019s beliefs and say well if person A does not want to murder then just do not, its not like they are forced to murder? This clearly does not work and we know that inherently but perhaps we need to look at the fundamental reason behind it. Person A and person B have a completely different view of what gives each person the right to life. Person B is essentially saying that they get to subjectively decide whether someone deserves to live or not. If they do not want someone in this world, they have the right to end to end their life. On the other hand, person A is saying, I cannot be the one to decide whether someone deserves to live or not. There needs to be someone or something objective that can determine this for us. This way we eliminate bias. (You might think this is an outrageous example but I ask you to think about abortion reread the example). Bias and subjectivity go hand in hand. There are many ways the world has attempted to address the issue of bias. One way is the social contract. If most of the population agrees on a particular issue, then it is decided that we have eliminated bias and now can make a more objective decision as to what is morally correct. We also see this in the court room in which they have multiple randomly selected jurors (at least in America). However, we come to an issue with the social contract in that people are limited in knowledge. People throughout history have made terrible moral decisions. Think about the number of people that followed Hitler in Germany or the number of people that wanted slavery in the US or the number of people who voted for the national party in South Africa to continue implementing Apartheid (segregation). Many of these people did not think of themselves as evil or even doing something evil, yet they were clearly facilitating and supporting some very evil regimes. Furthermore, if we go back in time, almost everybody believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that everything rotated around it. This we now know is clearly wrong. If we can make scientific mistakes in the past, what is it to say that we can not make moral mistakes now. Yes, we are evolving as a people and our understanding of truth, but that does not change the fact that something is true. 1000 years ago, the earth was still rotating around the sun and not the center of the universe. 1000 years ago, slavery was wrong. 1000 years ago racism was still wrong. This is all true whether we are in India, England, Serbia, Ghana, in a boat, on a mountain, etc. Even though people did not believe that does not change those facts. This is truth. The simple reality of truth is that when we follow it, order comes to this world. We eliminate chaos. Evil and suffering is a result of chaos. Therefore, if we know that truth exists and it does not depend on time or place, and we know that we are as a people are slowly discovering it as time goes on, then there has to be something outside of us that defines truth. If it were us, we would have found it. But since we are evolving towards truth and discovering it as we go along, who or what set the standard that we are trying to attain? If the answer is the universe, I ask you how something comprised of only matter and forces determined morality. One might say the universe made a certain morality conducive to optimal living, but that implies that the universe has a motive and is more than just matter and forces. Either way we get to a God that is no longer defined by science. This post is not going to go into why I think it is the God of the bible that is true (another post) but for now all statements will Assume that it is the Christian God that is true. The bible starts with a story that says almost exactly what we have been talking about. In Genesis firstly, we see God bring order to chaos in Genesis one then in Genesis two we are introduced to two trees. One is the tree of life and the other is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God forbids us from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But why? what is so bad about this tree. Why is it not just the tree of evil or the tree of death? The serpent then comes along and says that eating from the tree will make us like God which God also affirms in Genesis three. Why is this a problem? You see the issue here is God has defined how the universe works. He created it and brought order or truth to it. But when we decide to take the place of God and decide what good and evil is, we are biased. We have limited knowledge and experience. We have preferences. Ice cream is good. This makes it so easy for us to treat morality like a preference or like an ice cream. Is it not crazy that the cardinal original sin that man committed was deciding by ourselves what is good and evil. Yet, right now we live in a world that encourages exactly that. We have treated truth like it is a preference. But truth is objective. It does not matter whether you like gravity or not, it exists and you have to deal with it. Your opinion of it does not matter. It is the same with morality. To think that we get to decide morality is to commit the cardinal original sin and is playing God. Therefore, quite simply if God says something is true, then guess what\u2026 it is true. We should follow it. Because he designed the universe, what he says is true is what will bring the universe out of the chaos that we plunged it back into in Genesis three. Now here is where it gets interesting. What is it that the bible actually says is true regarding morality. There are 613 laws in the Old Testament. Is that what we are supposed to follow? Here is what I propose. In the new testament Jesus tells us that the two most important commandments are to Love God and love others and that these two commandments fulfill all the laws. I will explain this in greater depth in a later post, but essentially in the Old Testament God was giving us all these laws to teach us what love looks like and how to live it out. But everything can be summed up with love. Therefore, the only truth for morality that God gives us is love. It is about determining what the loving thing to do in each unique situation this chaotic world brings up. But before you commit the cardinal sin again and decide that what you are doing is loving, the challenge would be to read and study the bible and the examples it gives to learn why some things are loving and why some things are not. On top of that, we can use empirical evidence, logic and science to help us determine what is loving as well. But it gets more complicated than this. There are some things that are clearly grey. Alcohol is one of these topics. Dating is another. The question becomes how much alcohol is good. Living a drunken life is wrong but what about in-between. Dating as well. how should that look? These are complicated topics but Paul dresses this in a couple of places one of them being Romans 14. What at face value seems like a weird chapter promoting post modernism is actually the issue of grey that perhaps post modernism was trying to address but went too far. The idea is that for some people it is perfectly permissible to drink alcohol. They do not struggle with any sort of addiction to it and do not look to it for comfort and escapism but rather do it socially in moderation to improve relationships. Others however, may have been alcoholics in the past and any alcohol could trigger them into a bad downhill slide. The point is that people who drink alcohol have no right to force the sober people to drink but at the same time the sober people have no right in telling the alcohol drinkers that they are sinful and bad people. This should be really easy for a post modern to understand but many who are completely against post modernism forget that there are still some instances where it is grey and subjective per person. Oh but how many of us are there that are alcohol drinkers that should be sober? This can be an analogy applied to all different types of grey area issues. What is the objective loving thing to do? As Paul says that we should not let our christian freedom be used as an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another. (Galatians 5:13) There we have it. God designed the universe. He designed theology, morality, philosophy, science, math, etc. These things all are designed as components of truth that are designed to bring order to chaos. When we go against them we create chaos which creates chaos and suffering. These things do not change by time or place only in sense. I.e it will always be true to love but that can look different in different circumstances. As we go through this world we will discover what is true. God gave us a big head start with morality but culture changes and it is our job to continually adapt and figure out how to love best in different cultures. We will also continue to discover truth in all the other components. But discovering does not mean it was created but rather it was foundational from the beginning.","title":"What is Truth: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"truth/#what-is-truth-fundamentals-to-christianity","text":"Truth is a topic that many debate in our current age.

One is the tree of life and the other is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God forbids us from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But why? what is so bad about this tree. Why is it not just the tree of evil or the tree of death? The serpent then comes along and says that eating from the tree will make us like God which God also affirms in Genesis three. Why is this a problem? You see the issue here is God has defined how the universe works. He created it and brought order or truth to it. But when we decide to take the place of God and decide what good and evil is, we are biased. We have limited knowledge and experience. We have preferences. Ice cream is good. This makes it so easy for us to treat morality like a preference or like an ice cream. Is it not crazy that the cardinal original sin that man committed was deciding by ourselves what is good and evil. Yet, right now we live in a world that encourages exactly that. We have treated truth like it is a preference. But truth is objective. It does not matter whether you like gravity or not, it exists and you have to deal with it. Your opinion of it does not matter. It is the same with morality. To think that we get to decide morality is to commit the cardinal original sin and is playing God. Therefore, quite simply if God says something is true, then guess what\u2026 it is true. We should follow it. Because he designed the universe, what he says is true is what will bring the universe out of the chaos that we plunged it back into in Genesis three. Now here is where it gets interesting. What is it that the bible actually says is true regarding morality. There are 613 laws in the Old Testament. Is that what we are supposed to follow? Here is what I propose. In the new testament Jesus tells us that the two most important commandments are to Love God and love others and that these two commandments fulfill all the laws. I will explain this in greater depth in a later post, but essentially in the Old Testament God was giving us all these laws to teach us what love looks like and how to live it out. But everything can be summed up with love. Therefore, the only truth for morality that God gives us is love. It is about determining what the loving thing to do in each unique situation this chaotic world brings up. But before you commit the cardinal sin again and decide that what you are doing is loving, the challenge would be to read and study the bible and the examples it gives to learn why some things are loving and why some things are not. On top of that, we can use empirical evidence, logic and science to help us determine what is loving as well. But it gets more complicated than this. There are some things that are clearly grey. Alcohol is one of these topics. Dating is another. The question becomes how much alcohol is good. Living a drunken life is wrong but what about in-between. Dating as well. how should that look? These are complicated topics but Paul dresses this in a couple of places one of them being Romans 14. What at face value seems like a weird chapter promoting post modernism is actually the issue of grey that perhaps post modernism was trying to address but went too far. The idea is that for some people it is perfectly permissible to drink alcohol. They do not struggle with any sort of addiction to it and do not look to it for comfort and escapism but rather do it socially in moderation to improve relationships. Others however, may have been alcoholics in the past and any alcohol could trigger them into a bad downhill slide. The point is that people who drink alcohol have no right to force the sober people to drink but at the same time the sober people have no right in telling the alcohol drinkers that they are sinful and bad people. This should be really easy for a post modern to understand but many who are completely against post modernism forget that there are still some instances where it is grey and subjective per person. Oh but how many of us are there that are alcohol drinkers that should be sober? This can be an analogy applied to all different types of grey area issues. What is the objective loving thing to do? As Paul says that we should not let our christian freedom be used as an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another. (Galatians 5:13) There we have it. God designed the universe. He designed theology, morality, philosophy, science, math, etc. These things all are designed as components of truth that are designed to bring order to chaos. When we go against them we create chaos which creates chaos and suffering. These things do not change by time or place only in sense. I.e it will always be true to love but that can look different in different circumstances. As we go through this world we will discover what is true. God gave us a big head start with morality but culture changes and it is our job to continually adapt and figure out how to love best in different cultures. We will also continue to discover truth in all the other components. But discovering does not mean it was created but rather it was foundational from the beginning.","title":"What is Truth: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"vulnerability_trust_power/","text":"Vulnerability, Trust and Power Trust also known as faith is an integral part of many religious traditions. Many people ask the question where is your faith. Trust commonly reffered to as one of the most fundemental aspects within relationships as well. If trust of faith is so important, perhaps we need to define more precisely what it is and how do we get it or improve on it. Power on the other hand is the postmoderns answer to everything. Despite this ignorant and cynical attitude, we see that in many cases the reason is power. In fact, I think we will see that power stands in antithesis to trust. Furthermore, my overarching argument will be that trust which requires love and respect and altruism creates a better life for both the individual and the greater community than power does. The crazy part though is that power is a more successful attitude than doing nothing which is one why its so easy to think that power is the cause of everything and why many people end up resorting to it. Let us start with power. Power starts with a couple of assumptions. The first of these is that people are inherently selfish and do not care about what happens to other people. These types of arguments are evident in abortion protests where its my body my choice forgetting that there is another human being that is living inside the womb. It is surprising that the intersection between the number of people who are okay with abortion and those who advocate for some level of vegetariansim because harming other animals is evil and cruel is quite high. Perhaps, people only want to act morally superior if it goes with their agenda. But I digress.The second assumpiton is that in order for you to get something out of another person, you need to force or manipulate them to do so. In other words exert power over them. Remember people are selfish and do not care about others. So why would they do something for you. The next aspect of power is a more complicated idea of teaming up with a group of people who are generally like minded and for the good of your team/group they can maniplute/exert power over other groups to attain what is good for their group. Now if you do not already see how this progression is problematic, hopefully it will become clearer as this essay continues. Finally, you can see all the different groups that are more successful because they have been more powerful and have used that power to attain what they want at the expense of the less powerful. Now, in many cases this is true or atleast there is truth in it. Many people get oppressed for the luxury of the powerful and as a result the oppressed are worse off for it and can often struggle to switch the scales. This is in both group and individual terms. But hopefully by the end of this essay we will see that the powerful in this instance would be better off not oppressing the less powerful even if they can get exactly what they want from doing so. Let us imagine a scenario. Think of 3 young adult males who are interested in finding a girlfriend and ultimately a wife. They all want to have kids one day to continue their genes and heritage and so much more. Whenever the first guy would meet a girl he would act timid and would hardly say anything. He did not take any risk and ultimately ended up just getting rejected so many times that he gave up entirely. He did not work on himself or change or anyhting and ended up dying single. The second guy loved the sexual pleasure of girls and saw that and his progeny were the only thing he cared about. Because of that he indulged in the hookup lifestyle where he could take advantage of girls for his own pleasure. However, he could never have a proper relationship with any girl because that meant he could not hookup with other girls and he had to put in effort and do things he did not want to do. It also meant that he had to give up some vulnerability which was not worth the risk as he had been hurt before when he previously did. He ended up raping a girl because really what does it matter how she feels and he got what he wanted. He ended up with three kids from different mothers. He never married. The third guy tried a different approach. He took a lot of risks by putting himself out their. He made a lot of friends, worked out got his finances in order, found a job and spoke to as many girls as he could. He found a girlfriend initially but she ended up cheating on him. The he found another girl but she left him too. The he found another but he decided she was not it. After many years of trying and heartbreak, it seemed as if he might as well give up but he kept trying only to have another toxic relationship. Finally, he found the girl of his dreams. He never forced her to do anything instead he was willing to sacrifice. Why? Because he knew from past experience that if he wants a healthy connection with his girlfriend such that it would result in marriage, he needs to be willing to do things that are uncomfortable. But furthermore, he knew that he needed to gain her trust. Having been cheated on in the past, he knew exactly what it meant to be able to trust someone. He knew that was essential to their relationship. And so we have a little happily ever after story here. We see three different types of people in the thought experiment above. We see that the power hungry person ends up better off than the person who does nothing. And this is important. Because so often it is easy for us to look at a situation and say well I should have just manipulated that person or forced them to do that as it would have resulted in a better outcome. But too often we are comparing incorrectly. Either we are comparing to the first situation where using force does better than not doing anything or we are not comparing long term as the power hungry individual got what he wanted more than the third guy at the beginning. It is important to look at things from a zoomed out lens over time. More specifically we need to investigate the type of person we are becoming over time. We need to determine whether the person we are becoming is more enjoyable to be. Like I said at the beginning of this essay, I think that someone who people prefer to be around is happier than someone who is lonely. Okay, let us take a step back. There are many assumptions in the last statement so let us flesh them all out. For starters, written inbetween the lines is the idea that the goal in life is to be happy but maybe ever more than just happy its to be as happy as one could possibly be. Now, this statement is not completely obvious. Furthermore, it depends how one defines happy. Some other ideas of what we could desire to be is successful, to leave a legacy, to have achieved a purpose. There are other options that one could add here. Ultimately, I think that we want life to be something that is transcendent. Something that is higher than what we have right now. I think we want our life to be better. We want our life to have made an impact on this world and we want our life to have had an impact on others. We want to be remembered positively. In the bible I think this is what Jesus is referring to when he talks about life and eternal life. It is not just something we can attain after we die, in fact that would be missing the point when reading the bible. The word for eternal (aeonias) in the greek is qualitative word not a quantitative word. It is something that we can experience here on earth. It is something that we want to experience here on earth. One of the greatest travesties of this world is that there is a life that we can experience that is greater, more transcendent, eternal life as it were, but many do not know how. A caveot to this is that I think that is the gospel. That our job is to show others that there is a better way to live. I think fundementally, I cannot deduce further why we have a higher purpose or a greater calling or that there is something better to be attained in this life. It is easy to look at life cynically and deduce that it is just pain and suffering. It is fatalistic or luck based. But I think that the first principals of this world are that if we live out our purpose by using our skills and abilities to do something positive for the world, if we treat people well and form trust filled relationships, if we are willing to take risks and when we fail get up try again, then our life can result in eternal life. But to prove some of this deductively is very difficult if not impossible. Okay let us see what we can we prove deductively and let us look at the deductive implications and then let us look at the empirical evidence of the difference options. I think there are three options as identified earlier. Either people are paralyzed by fear, or people oppress others out of fear that they do not have control. This often looks like insecurity. Or finally people triumph over fear learn to trust and take risks. I do not think there is another option. In fact, one could reduce it further, we either live in fear or we do the opposite. I think what you will find is that any action you do in fear either oppresses yourself or someone else. Again, there are assumptions behind that. The first being that people are better off when they grow. Many people think it would be great to play video games your whole life with no responsibility. We think of someone like Dan Bylzarian or our favrite youtuber and assume that is the perfect life. We may undercut their level of responisibilty in their life but in any case, I will try show why I think responsibility is imperative to happiness. Jordan Peterson proposes that happiness is not the ultimate goal in life but rather fulfilling a purpose in life which requires showing responsibility. I think again this depends on the defition of happiness. In one sense what is fulfillness. I think it is a level of overarching or transcendent happiness. In any case whatever that is that is what we want. For the purpose of this essay I will call it total abundant life. Again I think this is what the bible is suggesting is eternal life. But that can be confusing so lets go with total abundant life. Back to why responsibilty will result in a more abundant life than static hedonistic bliss. The first argument goes back to a conversation I had with an atheist who suggested heaven would become boring quickly. The idea is that doing the same thing again and again becomes monotonous. Great songs when played too often no longer gice the same thrill. Playing the same video game often becomes boring after a while. Even sex the epitome of bliss loses the initial apex thrill after many occasions. However, the argument against that is simply well its still good. In fact, many people spend many hours doing just one thing and often becomeo very good at it. But that there is a self defeating statement because as soon as you get better at something, suddenly you are no longer static. There is some kind of growth. Even sex is something people get better at but what makes sex slightly different is that there is another person who has to like/love you enough to want to have sex with you. Often doing nothing is not good enough. Well what about stuff like porn or drugs or sugar or alcohol. Well, I really do not think I have to make an argument here as to why these things will not provide abundant life in itself. As in if all you did was eat, drink do drugs and watch porn in an attempt to make absolutely no growth and still be happy, I can tell you this will not last very long. The argument is simple. Without growth, life is not good. Incredibly, having an abundant life does not even seem to require growing in lots of different areas although I think the more one grows in the better. I think the level of an abundant life someone can attain by just working hard at one thing is substantially different working hard at nothing. Having said that, not everything passes as something we can work hard at in life. For example, (to overexaggerate) if someone was to spend all their time trying to be the best at showering and having the perfect shower, that would probably not help them in life as other issues will result in the person dealing with greater issues. Having said that, I think this showering person would still be better off than the porn and drug addict mentioned earlier or even someone that just sits around and watches tv each day. At the end of the day life is about growing. It is fundemental to having an abundant life. People who grow faster than others often enjoy life more. Now, that needs to be defined well again. One may think of growing as something we learn at school or some kind of academic knowledge growth. This idea would assume that PhDs should be the happiest people on the earth. However, there are so many facets to life that academic knowledge is just one facet of many in life that can incur growth. I would argue, and we will expound on this more later, that people who have the best social skills or people who others want to be around, typically have a more abundant life than others. But even this is not good enough as a stand alone statement. We have clarified that life requires growth. Now let us look at the things that prevent us from growing. Ultimately, they come down to different forms of fear. The dominant fear is based on the unknown. In order to grow you have to take yourself outside of your comfort zone and do something that is unfamiliar to you. This requires courage. The second thing that prevents us from growing is fatigue and pain. This is a fear that if you continue you will hurt yourself. It is more or a biological fear that your body just cannot actually do it. This shows that fear is not an irrational construct and deserves to be taken seriously. There are very real dangers and there are definitely things that we may be ill equipped to do at any given stage. Fear in this sense keeps us grounded. But we need to not let it paralyze us. Whether it is trying to get fitter or moving to a new city or starting a new job, we need to be put ourselves in an uncomfortable situation in order to grow but there is a limit. We go to that limit and then we stop. We recover. Then next time we can go further. And we repeat this process. If do not do this and let fear paralyze us and we oppress ourselves. We are literally taking that abundant life that we do have access to and we are letting it waste away. This is how we disrespect ourselves. Which when argued from hindsight is a form of self violation. One could simply define it as not loving ourselves. And we wonder why there are so many succesful self help books. The next aspect of fear worth looking at is control. It lies within insecurity that says I cannot trust someone else therefore, I must take control. This is also a form of anxiousness particularly when anxiousness is not something we can control. In other words its trying to control the uncontrollable. However, we can easily fall into naivety if we trust without fear. Other people are often not as reliable or as good at something as we would hope. Sometimes mistakes happen. We need to take this into account. Otherwise, we are just going to end up getting betrayed, or let down and eventually we cannot play the innocent and unlucky card. We need to be prepared for these things. The questions comes down to then how do we approach the world. Firstly, we need to ercognise that we are not able to control everything and that there needs to be trust. In fact, you will find yourself trusting in things more often than you think. We trust that our science is right and the world is not just going to blow up or collapse. We trust that our car will work and do as we expect. We trust that raffic light will work. Honestly, the list goes on. Everytime we get in our car and drive to work, we take courage. Now, even though this is a mundane thing we are comfortable doing it becasue we do it everyday. We are able to trust things that are repeatable and consistent. However, often people do not fit this mold particularly in relationships. Furthermore, peolpe change and can become different things. This means that even if someone has remained consistent for a while, things can change seemingly on a whim even though the change was far more gradual. See if you think closely about the two ideas with rehards to fear of growth and fear resulting in control, they really come down to the same thing. The reason we do not want to grow is because we know how to control what we currenlty have. This means that pushing ourselves takes courage. This means that establishing a new relationship takes courage. It is risky and fear is not something we should totally discard. BUt it is necessary. We should take precautions but the issue is there is a point that whatever precautions you want to take, you have to take some leap or step of faith or whatever you want to call it. There is a part where we have to abandon the control and take the risk. To do this we have to be prepared to fail. That is simply the hardest part. But it is part of the growing process. Perhaps you learned something about how you spoke or acted that cost you. Perhaps you just figured out that that person was not soemone good to be friends with or to date. Perhaps, now you have better parameters than before about what type of people to keep in your life. Perhaps you are better at identifying red flags. This is hard, and often we need to go back into our area of control to recuperate. But it is necessary to take the risk of being hurt -- not in a foolish or totally naive manner, which is why we have parents and mentors and teachers. It is necessary because as we established earlier, a totally abundant life is unnattainable without growth. Growth is fundemental to happiness. This means trust is fundemental to happiness. Let us talk more about trust. Trust has a strong link with vulnerablity. When we trust we make ourselves vulnerable. Fear encourages us to not be vulnerable because if we are too vulnerable we will probably die or get seriously hurt. This is exactly why adam and eve were naked in the garded. They were completely vulnerable. But becasue they did not fear anything they ended up getting hurt. Adam and Eve are clear representatives of all mankind. Is it not interesting that the first story in the bible is about the balance of fear, trust and vulnerablity. It is also about truth but we spoke about that already. I always used to be confused by the statement fear God in the bible. I knew we were told to trust God but I could not undeerstand how we could trust him and fear him. They seem to be at odds with each other. Many people I asked would always say something like it is a term for respect or you only have to fear God if you re not a christian. But I do not think this is what the statement is saying. I think it is about exactly what is written above. You need to have an element of fear otherwise, the snake will take your abundant life. Pure trust and naivety as lovely and wholesome and religious as it sounds is simply not correct. It is story number one of the bible. Obviously, this needs some further explanation. God is not just a person. He has personality and many aspects of a person but he is way more than that. God also is everything unknown. This may sound like a God of the gaps statement where as we discover more of the universe, God slowly diminishes but this is only part of it. God is also everything we have not yet discovered individually. This is why we are called to trust God. God has set up a universe that has an element of randomness at the human level (obviously we can argue that at the true scientific level everything can be predicted or at least follows a series of cause and effect chains. But you and I have no idea when an earthquake will happen next and furthermore, the freedom of choice within human and animals causes things to change. Therefore randomness is appropriate.) However, he has also set up a way in which we can live that will bring more growth and happiness. The following of this process is epitome of growth. This is why Jesus is the way and the logos/word. God is not just a person. Yes, we can relate to him like a person but limit of God is way too finite. God is everything that we are not. If something can be discovered then that has to exist in God even at the individual level. Trusting in God is follwoing his way he has setup. Fearing God is making sure we are not succombing to the randomness and unpredictability of the universe. If everything was totally predictable, Adam and Eve could have been naked and totally vulnerable so long as they are following in the way God has made for us. But things come up that are unexpected. These things are why we need to fear. The most imprtant verses in Job which are at the center of this highly chiastic book is 'the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and to shun evil is understanding. This is as simple as it gets. Fear God because random unwanted things happen such as all the terrible things that happened to Job. He needed to be prepared for these things to happen. But shuning evil is trusting that God's way is the right way. It is a combintation of both. There is another type of fear that we have not really explored which is the fear of shame and guilt that paralyses us. This idea again origninates in the story of Adam and Eve and is expounded upon incredibly through the rest of the Torah and then blownup to an incredible height by Jesus. The solution the bible gives is absulutely remarkable. It is this idea that we should live as if we are forgiven. As if that shame and guilt is not on us. It even encourages us to take the shame and guilt off other people by forgiving them. The verse that read forgive others so that God can forgive you used to really confuse me. I was confused by the idea that God had forgiven our sins yet only if we forgave everyone else. But again my idea on what abundant life is was so wrong. When we fail to forgive someone that means we leave a littlw bit of fear left in them that prevents them from growing. That growth is directly related to the relationship you had with them. This can be fleshed out more but not in this essay because often it is on a case by case basis but I will say this: moving on from a broken or tainted relationship is very hard especially as you try to determine what was your fault and what was theirs. Without forgiveness, it is difficult to fully move on as the relationship is still left adrift. Yes, of the other person opts to forgive it may be easier for them to move forward but the relationship is still left unresolved, In other words, unless both people forgive, shame and guilt still remain in both people. Therefore, a lack of forgiveness sucks joy from this world and prevents growth which ultimately is not a good thing. Therefore, not forgiving someone is a form of not forgiving yourself as you still contributed to making the world a worse place. Another thing I want to say about forgiveness is that forgiveness does not mean that you should let other live as corruptly as they want and then let them off the hook. In contrary, forgiving is more about teaching other people what they have done wrong while being willing to bear the consequences of what they did. The bible is a strong proponent of repentance. But repentance is much more complicated than just saying sorry. In jewish tradition there is 5 step process to repentance and one of the steps is going and making it right with the person you hurt. This means not just saying sorry to God and not just saying sorry to the other person but actively doing something that will completely compensate for the damage done. In the torah, it speaks about how you often have to pay back more than the wrong you did because there is a recognition that sinning violating someone does not just take things a way from them but goes deeper. But the process is all about realizing what you have done, what the imapcts are, why its wrong, who you've hurt, how badly you have hurt them then going out and trying to fix it. Often the damage done is more than can be repaid. Violation always goes deeper. This is why forgiveness is essential. It is almost impossible to reverse the bad you have done. Thereofore, someone forgiving you is them taking the burden on themselves and bearing the suffering that goes with it. It is a crazy idea that in order to have greater personal and communal happines and abundant life lies within being able to accept and take some of the suffering caused to you by someone who hurt you. We selfishly want other people to pay for all the hurt they caused but one of the most important aspects is that, they simply cannot regardless of how willing they are to try. This is why the concept of God incarnate coming to earth and taking on all that suffering is a truly revolutionary idea. But I guess it is more than an idea, it is a reality. It is this simple reality that prevents people from dying with their sins and an eternal corruption of the world. This is in the a most metaphyiscal way God literally saving the world.

For starters, written inbetween the lines is the idea that the goal in life is to be happy but maybe ever more than just happy its to be as happy as one could possibly be. Now, this statement is not completely obvious. Furthermore, it depends how one defines happy. Some other ideas of what we could desire to be is successful, to leave a legacy, to have achieved a purpose. There are other options that one could add here. Ultimately, I think that we want life to be something that is transcendent. Something that is higher than what we have right now. I think we want our life to be better. We want our life to have made an impact on this world and we want our life to have had an impact on others. We want to be remembered positively. In the bible I think this is what Jesus is referring to when he talks about life and eternal life. It is not just something we can attain after we die, in fact that would be missing the point when reading the bible. The word for eternal (aeonias) in the greek is qualitative word not a quantitative word. It is something that we can experience here on earth. It is something that we want to experience here on earth. One of the greatest travesties of this world is that there is a life that we can experience that is greater, more transcendent, eternal life as it were, but many do not know how. A caveot to this is that I think that is the gospel. That our job is to show others that there is a better way to live. I think fundementally, I cannot deduce further why we have a higher purpose or a greater calling or that there is something better to be attained in this life. It is easy to look at life cynically and deduce that it is just pain and suffering. It is fatalistic or luck based. But I think that the first principals of this world are that if we live out our purpose by using our skills and abilities to do something positive for the world, if we treat people well and form trust filled relationships, if we are willing to take risks and when we fail get up try again, then our life can result in eternal life. But to prove some of this deductively is very difficult if not impossible. Okay let us see what we can we prove deductively and let us look at the deductive implications and then let us look at the empirical evidence of the difference options. I think there are three options as identified earlier. Either people are paralyzed by fear, or people oppress others out of fear that they do not have control. This often looks like insecurity. Or finally people triumph over fear learn to trust and take risks. I do not think there is another option. In fact, one could reduce it further, we either live in fear or we do the opposite. I think what you will find is that any action you do in fear either oppresses yourself or someone else. Again, there are assumptions behind that. The first being that people are better off when they grow. Many people think it would be great to play video games your whole life with no responsibility. We think of someone like Dan Bylzarian or our favrite youtuber and assume that is the perfect life. We may undercut their level of responisibilty in their life but in any case, I will try show why I think responsibility is imperative to happiness. Jordan Peterson proposes that happiness is not the ultimate goal in life but rather fulfilling a purpose in life which requires showing responsibility. I think again this depends on the defition of happiness. In one sense what is fulfillness. I think it is a level of overarching or transcendent happiness. In any case whatever that is that is what we want. For the purpose of this essay I will call it total abundant life. Again I think this is what the bible is suggesting is eternal life. But that can be confusing so lets go with total abundant life. Back to why responsibilty will result in a more abundant life than static hedonistic bliss. The first argument goes back to a conversation I had with an atheist who suggested heaven would become boring quickly. The idea is that doing the same thing again and again becomes monotonous. Great songs when played too often no longer gice the same thrill. Playing the same video game often becomes boring after a while. Even sex the epitome of bliss loses the initial apex thrill after many occasions. However, the argument against that is simply well its still good. In fact, many people spend many hours doing just one thing and often becomeo very good at it. But that there is a self defeating statement because as soon as you get better at something, suddenly you are no longer static. There is some kind of growth. Even sex is something people get better at but what makes sex slightly different is that there is another person who has to like/love you enough to want to have sex with you. Often doing nothing is not good enough. Well what about stuff like porn or drugs or sugar or alcohol. Well, I really do not think I have to make an argument here as to why these things will not provide abundant life in itself. As in if all you did was eat, drink do drugs and watch porn in an attempt to make absolutely no growth and still be happy, I can tell you this will not last very long. The argument is simple. Without growth, life is not good. Incredibly, having an abundant life does not even seem to require growing in lots of different areas although I think the more one grows in the better. I think the level of an abundant life someone can attain by just working hard at one thing is substantially different working hard at nothing. Having said that, not everything passes as something we can work hard at in life. For example, (to overexaggerate) if someone was to spend all their time trying to be the best at showering and having the perfect shower, that would probably not help them in life as other issues will result in the person dealing with greater issues. Having said that, I think this showering person would still be better off than the porn and drug addict mentioned earlier or even someone that just sits around and watches tv each day. At the end of the day life is about growing. It is fundemental to having an abundant life. People who grow faster than others often enjoy life more. Now, that needs to be defined well again. One may think of growing as something we learn at school or some kind of academic knowledge growth. This idea would assume that PhDs should be the happiest people on the earth. However, there are so many facets to life that academic knowledge is just one facet of many in life that can incur growth. I would argue, and we will expound on this more later, that people who have the best social skills or people who others want to be around, typically have a more abundant life than others. But even this is not good enough as a stand alone statement. We have clarified that life requires growth. Now let us look at the things that prevent us from growing. Ultimately, they come down to different forms of fear. The dominant fear is based on the unknown. In order to grow you have to take yourself outside of your comfort zone and do something that is unfamiliar to you. This requires courage. The second thing that prevents us from growing is fatigue and pain. This is a fear that if you continue you will hurt yourself. It is more or a biological fear that your body just cannot actually do it. This shows that fear is not an irrational construct and deserves to be taken seriously. There are very real dangers and there are definitely things that we may be ill equipped to do at any given stage. Fear in this sense keeps us grounded. But we need to not let it paralyze us. Whether it is trying to get fitter or moving to a new city or starting a new job, we need to be put ourselves in an uncomfortable situation in order to grow but there is a limit. We go to that limit and then we stop. We recover. Then next time we can go further. And we repeat this process. If do not do this and let fear paralyze us and we oppress ourselves. We are literally taking that abundant life that we do have access to and we are letting it waste away. This is how we disrespect ourselves. Which when argued from hindsight is a form of self violation. One could simply define it as not loving ourselves. And we wonder why there are so many succesful self help books. The next aspect of fear worth looking at is control. It lies within insecurity that says I cannot trust someone else therefore, I must take control. This is also a form of anxiousness particularly when anxiousness is not something we can control. In other words its trying to control the uncontrollable. However, we can easily fall into naivety if we trust without fear. Other people are often not as reliable or as good at something as we would hope. Sometimes mistakes happen. We need to take this into account. Otherwise, we are just going to end up getting betrayed, or let down and eventually we cannot play the innocent and unlucky card. We need to be prepared for these things. The questions comes down to then how do we approach the world. Firstly, we need to ercognise that we are not able to control everything and that there needs to be trust. In fact, you will find yourself trusting in things more often than you think. We trust that our science is right and the world is not just going to blow up or collapse. We trust that our car will work and do as we expect. We trust that raffic light will work. Honestly, the list goes on. Everytime we get in our car and drive to work, we take courage. Now, even though this is a mundane thing we are comfortable doing it becasue we do it everyday. We are able to trust things that are repeatable and consistent. However, often people do not fit this mold particularly in relationships. Furthermore, peolpe change and can become different things. This means that even if someone has remained consistent for a while, things can change seemingly on a whim even though the change was far more gradual. See if you think closely about the two ideas with rehards to fear of growth and fear resulting in control, they really come down to the same thing. The reason we do not want to grow is because we know how to control what we currenlty have. This means that pushing ourselves takes courage. This means that establishing a new relationship takes courage. It is risky and fear is not something we should totally discard. BUt it is necessary. We should take precautions but the issue is there is a point that whatever precautions you want to take, you have to take some leap or step of faith or whatever you want to call it. There is a part where we have to abandon the control and take the risk. To do this we have to be prepared to fail. That is simply the hardest part. But it is part of the growing process. Perhaps you learned something about how you spoke or acted that cost you. Perhaps you just figured out that that person was not soemone good to be friends with or to date. Perhaps, now you have better parameters than before about what type of people to keep in your life. Perhaps you are better at identifying red flags. This is hard, and often we need to go back into our area of control to recuperate. But it is necessary to take the risk of being hurt -- not in a foolish or totally naive manner, which is why we have parents and mentors and teachers. It is necessary because as we established earlier, a totally abundant life is unnattainable without growth. Growth is fundemental to happiness. This means trust is fundemental to happiness. Let us talk more about trust. Trust has a strong link with vulnerablity. When we trust we make ourselves vulnerable. Fear encourages us to not be vulnerable because if we are too vulnerable we will probably die or get seriously hurt. This is exactly why adam and eve were naked in the garded. They were completely vulnerable. But becasue they did not fear anything they ended up getting hurt. Adam and Eve are clear representatives of all mankind. Is it not interesting that the first story in the bible is about the balance of fear, trust and vulnerablity. It is also about truth but we spoke about that already. I always used to be confused by the statement fear God in the bible. I knew we were told to trust God but I could not undeerstand how we could trust him and fear him. They seem to be at odds with each other. Many people I asked would always say something like it is a term for respect or you only have to fear God if you re not a christian. But I do not think this is what the statement is saying. I think it is about exactly what is written above. You need to have an element of fear otherwise, the snake will take your abundant life. Pure trust and naivety as lovely and wholesome and religious as it sounds is simply not correct. It is story number one of the bible. Obviously, this needs some further explanation. God is not just a person. He has personality and many aspects of a person but he is way more than that. God also is everything unknown. This may sound like a God of the gaps statement where as we discover more of the universe, God slowly diminishes but this is only part of it. God is also everything we have not yet discovered individually. This is why we are called to trust God. God has set up a universe that has an element of randomness at the human level (obviously we can argue that at the true scientific level everything can be predicted or at least follows a series of cause and effect chains. But you and I have no idea when an earthquake will happen next and furthermore, the freedom of choice within human and animals causes things to change. Therefore randomness is appropriate.) However, he has also set up a way in which we can live that will bring more growth and happiness. The following of this process is epitome of growth. This is why Jesus is the way and the logos/word. God is not just a person. Yes, we can relate to him like a person but limit of God is way too finite. God is everything that we are not. If something can be discovered then that has to exist in God even at the individual level. Trusting in God is follwoing his way he has setup. Fearing God is making sure we are not succombing to the randomness and unpredictability of the universe. If everything was totally predictable, Adam and Eve could have been naked and totally vulnerable so long as they are following in the way God has made for us. But things come up that are unexpected. These things are why we need to fear. The most imprtant verses in Job which are at the center of this highly chiastic book is 'the fear of God is the beginning of wisdom and to shun evil is understanding. This is as simple as it gets. Fear God because random unwanted things happen such as all the terrible things that happened to Job. He needed to be prepared for these things to happen. But shuning evil is trusting that God's way is the right way. It is a combintation of both. There is another type of fear that we have not really explored which is the fear of shame and guilt that paralyses us. This idea again origninates in the story of Adam and Eve and is expounded upon incredibly through the rest of the Torah and then blownup to an incredible height by Jesus. The solution the bible gives is absulutely remarkable. It is this idea that we should live as if we are forgiven. As if that shame and guilt is not on us. It even encourages us to take the shame and guilt off other people by forgiving them. The verse that read forgive others so that God can forgive you used to really confuse me. I was confused by the idea that God had forgiven our sins yet only if we forgave everyone else. But again my idea on what abundant life is was so wrong. When we fail to forgive someone that means we leave a littlw bit of fear left in them that prevents them from growing. That growth is directly related to the relationship you had with them. This can be fleshed out more but not in this essay because often it is on a case by case basis but I will say this: moving on from a broken or tainted relationship is very hard especially as you try to determine what was your fault and what was theirs. Without forgiveness, it is difficult to fully move on as the relationship is still left adrift. Yes, of the other person opts to forgive it may be easier for them to move forward but the relationship is still left unresolved, In other words, unless both people forgive, shame and guilt still remain in both people. Therefore, a lack of forgiveness sucks joy from this world and prevents growth which ultimately is not a good thing. Therefore, not forgiving someone is a form of not forgiving yourself as you still contributed to making the world a worse place. Another thing I want to say about forgiveness is that forgiveness does not mean that you should let other live as corruptly as they want and then let them off the hook. In contrary, forgiving is more about teaching other people what they have done wrong while being willing to bear the consequences of what they did. The bible is a strong proponent of repentance. But repentance is much more complicated than just saying sorry. In jewish tradition there is 5 step process to repentance and one of the steps is going and making it right with the person you hurt. This means not just saying sorry to God and not just saying sorry to the other person but actively doing something that will completely compensate for the damage done. In the torah, it speaks about how you often have to pay back more than the wrong you did because there is a recognition that sinning violating someone does not just take things a way from them but goes deeper. But the process is all about realizing what you have done, what the imapcts are, why its wrong, who you've hurt, how badly you have hurt them then going out and trying to fix it. Often the damage done is more than can be repaid. Violation always goes deeper. This is why forgiveness is essential. It is almost impossible to reverse the bad you have done. Thereofore, someone forgiving you is them taking the burden on themselves and bearing the suffering that goes with it. It is a crazy idea that in order to have greater personal and communal happines and abundant life lies within being able to accept and take some of the suffering caused to you by someone who hurt you. We selfishly want other people to pay for all the hurt they caused but one of the most important aspects is that, they simply cannot regardless of how willing they are to try. This is why the concept of God incarnate coming to earth and taking on all that suffering is a truly revolutionary idea. But I guess it is more than an idea, it is a reality. It is this simple reality that prevents people from dying with their sins and an eternal corruption of the world. This is in the a most metaphyiscal way God literally saving the world. Whenever someone dies with their sins unpaid for, nu fear of God sex inflation growth is abundant life not a destinantion","title":"Vulnerability, Trust and Power"}]}
