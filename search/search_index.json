Love is the true definition of purpose although in later blogs we will talk about how that purpose looks slightly more practically. This blog will define love. Now if you have not read the previous blog on truth, you should do that first as it explains how we know something is true and gives the context to love. Love is the backbone to all morality. What we will be doing today is looking at the laws God gives to determine how to love. Therefore, the best place to start is in genesis. Now if we start with the prolog to the Abraham story, we have several incredible stories about how God sets up this universe. Since this is not an in depth study of genesis, I will be pointing out the major points (and sometimes the link or evidence might not be so clear. I will go through these stories in more depth at a later point). In Genesis 1:1-3, we already see God\u2019s intention with the world. The word Elohim meaning God has the connotation of a judge. Now, in Hebrew, the point of a judge is to restore things to order. This has two sides, punishment/destruction or forgiveness and mercy. Either way the goal is restoration. God never does something outside of the intention of restoration. This is exactly what we see God do in these verses. The universe is chaotic nothingness and God then says let there be light. This is the first step in restoring order. He then spends the rest of genesis one bring order to the chaos. Then in Genesis 3 we sin and bring chaos back into the world. The rest of the bible is God revealing his plan on how he is bringing order back to this world. The difference is, we are involved with it and it is our job to do our part in bringing order to chaos in this world. Okay so far we know that our purpose has to do with bringing order to chaos. Therefore, love has to do the same thing. If what you do does not bring order to this world, it is not love but if what you do does bring order to this world, then it is love. Okay, but how do we know if something brings order? Well that is what the bible will help us understand. Next stop the tower of babel. The tower of babel has become one of my favorite stories once I finally understood what it was saying. It is way more complicated than what I will explain here and it is interlinked with the Noah story and the garden of eden story. The links are fascinating and brilliant but for another time. The main point of the tower of babel story lies in the line, we will make a name for ourselves. This statement is beautifully juxtaposed to the beginning of the Abraham story. Abraham chooses Sarah knowing she is barren. Therefore, he sacrifices his own chance to have children and a heritage in order to restore honor to Sarah\u2019s father and show compassion on Sarah. This is a huge commitment and one that certainly does not benefit Abrahams name. Does that ring a bell? You see the reason God chose Abraham while he ended the plans of the people trying to build a giant tower is because of whose name they were doing it for. The tower of babel did it for their own name while Abraham did it for someone else name. Okay, so we are making progress. The first definition of restoring order is when we make someone else\u2019s name great and not ours. We are willing to sacrifice our own name for success of someone else. There is a lot in genesis about what making someone else\u2019s name great looks like but we will skip most of it for the sake of brevity but two things worth paying attention too are: how important hospitality is and reconciliation between broken relationships. The hospitality we see in Abraham, Lot and Sodom and Gomorrah, and Rebekah. The reconciliation we see between Jacob and Esau, Rachel and Leah, and Joseph and his brothers. Moving to exodus. We are introduced to the law but particularly the 10 commandments. These seemingly simple commandments are so much richer than most think. First let\u2019s list the commandments. I am the Lord your God You shall have no other gods before me, you shall not make an idol for yourself You shall not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. You shall keep the sabbath holy Honor your mother and father Do not murder Do not commit adultery Do not steal Do not bear false witness Do not covet anyone\u2019s possessions Now we know that the 10 commandments had two tablets. Therefore the first thing you think about is there must be link between the first half and the second half. You would be right. Now if we look at the first five and the second five, what is common to each side. What we see is the first five are the relationship between you and your creators and the second five is the relationship between you and your peers or everyone else. Now what is the link? Creator Command Peer Command Link I am the Lord your God Do not murder Do not do away with others. You shall have no other gods before me, you shall not make an idol for yourself Do not commit adultery Do not betray relationships. You shall not take the Lord\u2019s name in vain. Do not steal Do not sabotage someone\u2019s dignity. You shall keep the sabbath holy Do not bear false witness Do not sabotage someone\u2019s reputation. Honor your mother and father Do not covet anyone\u2019s possessions Do not violate your own life. Let\u2019s talk more about these links. Why would you want to murder someone. It would be because you do not want them in your life. Another way you can do that is by ignoring them. And that is exactly what we do with God. Jesus took this further and said if you\u2019re angry you have committed murder. We can see that the first thing you want when you are angry at someone is for them to no longer exist or be out of your life. Now what happens when your commit adultery? You betray a relationship. That is exactly what you do when you put idols before God. Jesus says if you look at someone in lust, you have committed adultery. It is easy to see how you have betrayed that relationship in your heart as you are putting someone else ahead of a more important relationship. Lust always has the meaning of exploiting something or someone for your own pleasure. When it comes to sexuality, it looks like adultery. Notice, the betrayal of a relationship doesn\u2019t start with the goal to spite or betray the original relationship but rather a selfish desire pleasure yourself. However, as usual when we put ourselves ahead of others especially in a lustful manner, others often get hurt. What about God\u2019s name and stealing. One thing to note is that the word in the Torah used for steal suggests kidnapping. When we steal we violate someone\u2019s dignity. We do not care about their worth or who they are. Taking God\u2019s name in vain is the same thing. We are taking what God has and we are tarnishing it. Each person has inherent not based on what we do. When we take advantage of someone because we think they are less than or don\u2019t deserve what they have for our own selfish gain, we violate their own God given value. With regards to sabbath and lying, we change from violating inherent value to reputation. We are discarding what the actions of that person or even sabotaging them. When God created the world he rested at the end. Therefore as an ode to Hod we rest as well to acknowledge he is our creator and has ultimate control. The Jews also remember the sabbath as a remembrance for how God brought them out of Egypt. Both these acts acknowledge what God did. When we violate sabbath, we are lying about what God has done. We should instead be celebrating the good works of others and not seeking to lie for own personal gain. But furthermore if someone else has done something bad we should not lie about it for personal gain. The truth wins out and must be made known. The last relationship is about being content with who you are. We need to recognize that our parents gave us life and should honor them for it. If we spite them for that we violate ourselves as we undermine our own existence. It\u2019s the same with coveting. It\u2019s this idea that you want to be someone else. We need to recognize that God has given us value and he loves us. He knitted us together in our mothers womb and has a purpose for our lives. Now we get to the third layer. We can see how each relationship has to do with violation. We start with violation of their physical existence. We then have a violation of relationships. Next is a violation of inherent value. Followed by a violation of action. This results in a total violation of self. Which is why the final violation is a recognition that if someone else cannot be violate then I should not be violated either. Rabbi Hillel was asked how would you sum up the Torah. His response was don\u2019t do to others what you would despise. It is easy to see as we went through the Ten Commandments exactly what Hillel was saying. What we can also see is that these commandments are more about respect than love. This is because we can\u2019t love unless we first respect the person. Love is the creation of a union but if this union is not based on respect then it will turn into abuse. This is why Jesus took Hillel\u2019s comment further and turned it positive. Do to others as you would like to be treated. What we see from Jesus is more of an emphasis to create relationships. He definitely still emphasizes respect but is encouraging a complete union of people. Which leads us to the most important commandments: love God with everything and love others as yourself. The as yourself is the interesting add on here. You see how since this statement is based on respect which is a reference to the Ten Commandments, we need to respect ourselves in fact love ourselves before we can love others. This means love starts with individuals and slowly combines with others to create communities until we are one in mind and goal. This is an obvious call back to the Tower of Babel where there the people were one in mind and goal. The difference is the goal won\u2019t be to make their own name great but rather God\u2019s name great. This is what the Jews refer to as the messianic age, what Jesus calls the kingdom of grace and what we call the new heavens and new earth. However, there is one element missing to love. It is the idea that love is linked to purpose. We see God map out our purpose in Genesis one and two that we should. (We will map out this in more detail in a later blog). These purposes are about imitating God in creating and relationships. Since love is about creating a union in order to execute Gods purpose for us, love needs to be about technological advancement, human propagation as well as a union in mind and goal with respect. All this to glorify God.","title":"What is Love: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"LOVE/#what-is-love-fundamentals-to-christianity","text":"Love is the most fundamental thing to understand as a christian or as any person.

And many would think this should be the end of the blog post but somehow we have confused what it means to exist and the existence of other things. Existence has multiple facets to it. Let\u2019s start with a person and work outwards. Each person obviously has a physical body. This body works amazingly well as we have discovered in biology. This part of us keeps us alive and allows us to interact with the physical world. This physical body is totally unique to any other person in the world. However, each person has an essence which is common between all humans such that we can identify someone as a human despite them being unique and different from all other humans. Now, this is where it gets complicated. If something is created that means it was created for a purpose. It is not possible to create something without a purpose. Now the fact that all humans have the same essence must mean that we have either the same purpose or the purpose is derived in a similar way, yet because we have unique bodies, the way in which we will accomplish these purposes has to be different. The next important step is that we see God says we are his image bearers. Therefore, at the core of our essence and therefore purpose is to image God or to act like God. Since, God is not a physical being, our purpose can not be related to our physical attributes. For example, Catholics often talk about not being allowed to use contraception. They derive this idea from sex having an purpose of union and procreations. Therefore because contraception prevents procreation, it\u2019s is sinful. This article is not going to argue about any that but rather just point out that that is outside the essence of God. Instead we derive purpose from God which amazingly turns out to be about those two things \u2014 creating and relationships. Therefore, we see sex (a physical attribute) be used to fulfill our purpose as opposed to something we derive purpose from. This is the right template to follow: how can we use our physical body and the physical world to fulfill God\u2019s purpose for us. To continue this idea, other philosophers talk about every thing in the world having an essence and they go further and say therefore each thing has a purpose. They come to this conclusion by stating that we put things into categories and can tell which is which despite things being unique. However, this only categorizes God\u2019s purpose for them. They do not show us our purpose but rather can be used to fulfill our God imaging purpose. Therefore, we should view things in this world as tools or obstacles. Each thing is either something that helps us achieve our purposes or hinders us. How and whether it is a tool or obstacle depends on a robust understanding of our purpose which is in a different blog post. Now, in addition to an essence and physical body, we also have a conscious. This conscious is the part of us that firstly realizes we exist but secondly allows us to have free will. This is the part of us that allows us to act according to our purpose or deviate to from it. Furthermore, our conscious is linked to our mind which has the ability to learn. This enables us to fulfill our purpose in a fuller way or better way. The less we know, the more instinctually we can fulfill our purpose. Furthermore, part of our purpose requires us to learn. If it wasn\u2019t clear in the previous paragraphs, our essence, our physical body our mind and conscious are intrinsically linked. Therefore, we cannot separate them. We do not have the wrong body or the wrong mind etc. We are all fearfully and wonderfully made and knitted together in our mother\u2019s womb by God specifically to fulfill God\u2019s over arching purpose in a unique way that only each person can fulfill. To decide that any facet of us is not good is the equivalent of thinking that bringing a knife to gunfight is a good decision. At a 3000 foot view, many people exist and they are all trying to fulfill a God imaging purpose as well. Since our purposes all come from God, they must all ultimately work together to fulfill something great and beautiful. Therefore, if in fulfilling your purpose, you counteract the fulfilling of someone else\u2019s purpose, clearly the way you are fulfilling your purpose is incorrect. The same holds if fulfilling one of your purposes counteracts the fulfillment of another of your purposes.","title":"What is existence: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"existence/#what-is-existence-fundamentals-to-christianity","text":"The most obvious aspect of life is that we exist.

To continue this idea, other philosophers talk about every thing in the world having an essence and they go further and say therefore each thing has a purpose. They come to this conclusion by stating that we put things into categories and can tell which is which despite things being unique. However, this only categorizes God\u2019s purpose for them. They do not show us our purpose but rather can be used to fulfill our God imaging purpose. Therefore, we should view things in this world as tools or obstacles. Each thing is either something that helps us achieve our purposes or hinders us. How and whether it is a tool or obstacle depends on a robust understanding of our purpose which is in a different blog post. Now, in addition to an essence and physical body, we also have a conscious. This conscious is the part of us that firstly realizes we exist but secondly allows us to have free will. This is the part of us that allows us to act according to our purpose or deviate to from it. Furthermore, our conscious is linked to our mind which has the ability to learn. This enables us to fulfill our purpose in a fuller way or better way. The less we know, the more instinctually we can fulfill our purpose. Furthermore, part of our purpose requires us to learn. If it wasn\u2019t clear in the previous paragraphs, our essence, our physical body our mind and conscious are intrinsically linked. Therefore, we cannot separate them. We do not have the wrong body or the wrong mind etc. We are all fearfully and wonderfully made and knitted together in our mother\u2019s womb by God specifically to fulfill God\u2019s over arching purpose in a unique way that only each person can fulfill. To decide that any facet of us is not good is the equivalent of thinking that bringing a knife to gunfight is a good decision. At a 3000 foot view, many people exist and they are all trying to fulfill a God imaging purpose as well. Since our purposes all come from God, they must all ultimately work together to fulfill something great and beautiful. Therefore, if in fulfilling your purpose, you counteract the fulfilling of someone else\u2019s purpose, clearly the way you are fulfilling your purpose is incorrect. The same holds if fulfilling one of your purposes counteracts the fulfillment of another of your purposes.","title":"What is existence: fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"legalism/","text":"Getting out of the Court Room: the Antidote to Legalism We live in the time of the blessing and curse of John Calvin\u2019s prominent substitutionary atonement where the only understanding we seem to have of salvation is with a court room analogy. Jesus took our place and so now we are not guilty. But let\u2019s talk about this judgment day. Judgement Day is linked to the jewish festival of Rosh Hashanah. This festival is a celebration. Justice is the word mishpat in Hebrew which we have so egregiously misinterpreted. Many only understand justice under the sense of things being made fair. People getting punished for doing wrong. But this is so incomplete. Justice has always been about restoring order, and making things right. Yes punishment is often a part of this. But so is mercy and compassion. God did not destroy the evil assyrians who deserved to be punished because he saw potential in them. He said I believe these people can still do good in this world. But sometimes God does punish. It\u2019s a balance. Many parents recognize the complexity behind it when raising children. However, in Exodus 34, God gives us the ratio 1000:3 compassion to punishment. His judgements are rooted in mercy. Judgement day is about making things right. Believe it or not but this is demonstrated in the first 3 verses of the bible. Elohim the word for God is connected to God being judge. Then we had a formless and void and dark world. This represents chaos. The God said let there be light and began to bring order to chaos. He began making things right. We then brought chaos to order in Genesis 3 and so God has spent the rest of the bible and human history working with us to bring chaos back to order. With this backdrop Let\u2019s talk about two groups of people in second temple Judaism. Pharisees: spoke about last week putting fences around the law so to not break them this is tremendous zeal. This is your psalm 119 love your law idea. Issue not what goes in that defines you but what comes out. Talk about actors. Herodians: subscribe to Judaism but are too absorbed in the pleasures and entertainment of this world. But are able to adapt and interact with culture. Often as new Christians we end up doing one of two things: Either get on this weird cycle where we act like Pharisees we love the law so much. Our zeal encourages us to obey every law. We want to do everything possible to make sure we have followed all his commands. Why? Because that\u2019s what real Christians do right. They take God\u2019s commands seriously. Then we get to this point where we realize we are trying to earn our salvation. We realize that we just can\u2019t obey all these commands. We start to feel distant from God. So we read Ephesians 2:8 and similar. We determine that we need to stop doing works to please God. Therefore, we stop being legalistic and start living in the freedom of Gods victory except with one caveat. We hated our striving for obedience to God\u2019s law that we abandon any law. Our lives look no different than the world. We give in to antinomianism. Then what happens? We end up falling into sin so far that we determine that this is not Christianity. We wonder if we have lost our salvation again and guess what we change back into the cycle of legalism. We read James two and all these commands in the New Testament and determine we aren\u2019t Christians unless we do these things. This cycle continues as we fluctuate between Pharisees and herodians. Each time it gets more subtle and until like too many Christians in America we fall into the negative of the Pharisees and negative of herodians. People who act like we love God and do Christian things but we love the world and are consumed by its pleasures. But the main symptom of this is how do I know if I am saved? How do I know that God sees me as good enough? The other option is we mentally backfile all the seemingly contradictory or complicated scripture and go on with our lives that God saved us. This generally results in a lack of zeal and can often result in looking like herodians. We end up compartmentilizing the Gospel and God\u2019s word and could live contradictory lives. Again the fear is that we look like the bad part of the pharisees and the bad part of the herodians. Let us take a quick deviation. Just before passover every year Pilot recognizing that at Passover most Jews would be in Jerusalem and that it is remembering an event that overthrew the Egyptians, decided that he would go to Jerusalem as well except with an army ready to suppress the Jews. He would ride a white stallion which symbolizes military conquest with an army of soldiers. He would instill fear as the Romans would continue to oppress the Jews. At the same time, Jesus rides in on a donkey with his disciples pronouncing favor and peace. Jesus came to announce his kingdom at the same time pilot was announcing his. This is crazy. And the people wave palm branches symbolizing a revolution. They know exactly what Jesus is doing. Everyone has noticed \u2026 or do they? The next thing Jesus does is cry. Wait what? Why? Well, the Jews had completely missed Jesus\u2019 whole mission. They wanted the wrong kingdom. They wanted revenge on the Romans. Hosanna means Lord, Save us. Jesus did come to save them. But Jesus came to die. This is how he saved us and this is how he wants us to do? You see that entire cycle is completely consumed with self. All it cared about is its own salvation. Did Jesus not do the complete opposite on the cross. He could have saved himself but instead he gave up his life for us. He tells us to take up our cross and follow him Matthew 10:38. Paul says he wishes he could die for others to be saved. Romans 9:1-3. Here is the question. What kingdom do you want? Let\u2019s go back to this day of judgment. Remember purpose is not only to bring retributive justice on the evil people. This is the kingdom that the jews want and sadly this is what substutionary atonement is overly consumed with. We must be punished for wrong doing. But this is not true. 1000:3. This is the day that Jesus returns to make everything right. To bring order to chaos. But that is done by bringing Gods kingdom. This kingdom is about self sacrifice. This is what it looks like for the world to be made right. It is this upside down kingdom. It is this sacrificial love. It is about giving up ourselves for others not us focusing on what saves us. So this is where we get out the court room. We stop focusing on how to get saved and we start focusing on how to save others. There is personal salvation, which we all have for accepting Jesus. But now we leave the court room. The verdict is in. We are justified. But I really want you to broaden your understanding of salvation. There is also global salvation. This should be where our focus should be. Salvation is not just about accepting Jesus as Lord it is about bringing chaos to order. Bringing God\u2019s Kingdom to earth. There is one more thing I want to talk about which is essential. It is this idea of Sabbath. It is that weird commandment in the 10 commandments that we do not understand how it links to today\u2019s world. Sometime I will talk to you about the 10 commandments. Sabbath is more than about rest. It is also about Honoring God. We rest to show that we trust God has control. Sabbath is about letting go. Sabbath is letting the good works you have done be good works. If we don\u2019t do that and keep adding to them, they never become good works because they can never establish relationship. This is complex but important as it is essential to dethroning legalism and fear. Sabbath is saying that what I have done this week is good and now I trust God that he will use it. If we never stop to rest we are not trusting God, we are not giving up control. We are not telling the truth about God that he created this universe and is in control. Ultimately, if we do not stop trying to save ourselves and be a perfect christian by doing all these good works, we rob ourselves of this trusting relationship with God. And look at that if we don\u2019t sabbath, we are making it about ourselves again. We are playing God. We are trying to save ourselves. God has called us to trust in him and focus on others. So get out of the court room, be a living sacrifice for others good and God\u2019s kingdom, and rest in the fact that God is in control and that he is using our good works for his kingdom. Remember his judgements are rooted in mercy.","title":"Getting out of the Court Room: the Antidote to Legalism"},{"location":"legalism/#getting-out-of-the-court-room-the-antidote-to-legalism","text":"We live in the time of the blessing and curse of John Calvin\u2019s prominent substitutionary atonement where the only understanding we seem to have of salvation is with a court room analogy.

We spoke about how Genesis two is more important but how we cannot attain that until we have developed enough to be able to properly fulfill our purpose of love and relationships and family which ultimately is just growing of self as we spoke about as well. Then last blog we talked about how this purpose goes wrong as we talked about the fall in Genesis three. Today, I want to talk about some of the complexities of this purpose which believe it or not can be examined in the story of Cain and Abel. It is like God knew what he was doing when he inspired the bible. The other crazy part is that we could do another series on Genesis one through 11 and we could dive deep without even getting into the meaning of life. Genesis is so deep and beautiful. Anyway I digress. Nihilism is a common topic that people talk about in philosophy. Many people argue that life has no meaning and that everything is predetermined and so what is the point. This is on a grand scale, but on a smaller scale it looks far more like what Cain experienced. You may be wandering how this relates. Well, let us think about it. One of the most striking parts of the story with Cain and Abel is that Cain still makes a sacrifice. We like to gloss over the fact that Cain made a sacrifice and presume that it was so bad that he deserved to be punished. Now, if you are Cain after finding out your sacrifice was not good enough what might one of your first thoughts be? Yes, there are many options but one of them might be well why did I even make this sacrifice in the first place? You see in order to make a sacrifice \u2014 even a bad one \u2014 still requires effort. He could have said well I should have not even tried. I would have been in the same place as I am now except I could have had more fun in the past. Is this not the driving factor behind nihilism? That any work we put in now is not worthwhile so what is the point of putting work in in any case. Now you might object and say well Abel\u2019s sacrifice was good enough and you would be absolutely right. I mean two blogs ago we showed what the meaning of life is. But here is the interesting part. Now remember when we read the bible, we need to make sure we are not assuming the bible is missing information. We like to add words to the bible that are not there. One thing that is not there is why Cain\u2019s sacrifice is not good enough. All we know is that God said if he does what is right then he will be accepted. Yet, we still do not really know what he did wrong. In the text it says he gathered some of the fruit while Abel gathered fat portions. (There is clearly a link here between the sacrificial system that I do not yet know enough. More research needed). One important difference though is that Abel brought the first born while Cain did not. Now, if think about this on a metaphorical level, what we see is that Abel gave his best while Cain did not. This is something useful to know but it has a number of complexities. The first one is: if you cannot give your best should we not do it at all? The second is how do we know if we have given our best. The third question could be what if we hit a situation where giving your first born is all you have. I am sure all of you went straight to thinking about Abraham and Issac there. This is exactly what the bible is all about. Taking these major themes and expanding on them. This becomes the crux of life. It is tough to be perfect \u2014 well impossible. This means that we are going to fail and sometimes it is not even our fault. Who knows why Cain did not produce a sacrifice worthy to God? Who knows if he even knew whether it was good enough or not? But is this not exactly where the complexities of life lie. Yes, sin prevents us from living out our purpose and ultimately, that is the reason given in this passage that cost Cain. You see there is no clear evidence in the text that God was even referring to the sacrifice when he said if you do what is right. It just said that God did not look favorably on his sacrifice. I think this is the key. We like to merge these two ideas. but they are two different things. One idea revolves around being accepted. The other idea is about doing a sacrifice. This is an important distinction. You see in life we have two options: we can either take the risk of achieving some purpose in life or we can live Hakuna Matata. I still love how people wear Hakuna Matata shirts when one of the main points of the Lion King was to show that that is not the point of life. It is like they did not see the whole movie. In any case, in the movie Simba is faced with the option, either he continues though life living like there are no worries or he must fulfill his purpose and try take down Scar. Now, I want to emphasize here that this is where the movie can sometimes miss reality by over exaggerating the success rate. How many times have we metaphorically tried to take down Scar and failed. How many times are you willing to try take down Scar before you just decide my Hakuna Matata life was more fun. The crazy part is that either way Timone and Pumba would have accepted Simba. He was not sinning by not taking down Scar but Rafiki (the monkey) did not look favorably on him. It is interesting how we can see two sides of God in Rafiki in that he accepted Simba but also did not look favorably on him. Here is another thought though. How long could Simba have live in Hakuna Matata world until the lack of purpose in his life would have driven him to despair. Well in Cain\u2019s case, not very long. And he even tried to take down Scar. This is the crux. We live in a world where we are trying to find purpose. We cannot find it solely in creating (job and money and power). We are also cannot find it solely in relationships (family friends and community). However, the second is more important at the end of the day. But sometimes we are not able to fulfill that purpose exactly right. This is why the loss of a job, or a broken relationship or rejection is so hurtful. It is why the first impulse we have when this happens is to get a rebound, drink alcohol, eat comfort food and binge Netflix. This is what Nihilism is. It is complete rejection of purpose. You will find that most people who end up shooting up campuses or something similar are people who have been so hurt by the world due to failure to sacrifice effectively enough such that they end up blaming the world and decide that the only solution is to get revenge on the world by causing as much chaos as possible. Starting to sound even more like Cain? The crazy part of the story of Cain and Abel is that after Cain kills Abel, God still shows some love to Cain as he says anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over. What a crazy statement. Why would God care about what happens to Cain? Well, the point of the story comes right here. God Accepts us and loves us regardless of how successful we are but God will use successful people differently. Furthermore, there is absolutely punishment for sin but there is also forgiveness and second chances. The encouragement from God is keep trying but you actually need to put some effort in. You need to try your best. This leaves one issue left to resolve. How do we handle the situations of rejection and failure. How do we handle that pain? The answer I believe is partly answered in Ecclesiastes. There is this weird refrain in the book saying eat drink and be merry. The idea is that, life is hard and does have all these terrible things that may not even be our fault. Therefore, we should eat drink and be merry. But not at the expense of purpose. There is a balance between Hakuna Matata and fulfilling our purpose Another part of it is just a common theme in the bible. When we love people we take a risk. We do not know how it is going to work out. But taking that risk is more important than not. Otherwise, we could never have anything. When God created us he took the risk that we would not choose him. Therefore, we need to risk in the world. We need to love in this world. Yes, it hurts so much much when we face rejection or it fails. But this is where our purpose lies. Either we try to attain our purpose or we spiral into despair. Fundamentally, this life comes down to a simple analogy. How many times can you pick your self up after you fail to try again and achieve your purpose. If we view life in this perspective perhaps we can see failure in a different perspective. In the movie Meet the Robinsons, the family celebrates his success when he fails. Why, because they know the potentiality behind someone who tries. They realize that becoming a Goob or a Cain is the result of not trying. So perhaps our purpose in life has an added layer. Perhaps, our purpose is not just to achieve success in creating and relationships. Perhaps, our purpose has to do with trying to attain that. But when we do not do it well there are consequences and it hurts but at the end of the day is worth celebrating to some degree. And God seems to agree with that to some degree. He asks Cain why he is downcast and why he is angry. It is like God um come on seriously? You just told him he did not do a good job with his sacrifice. It reminds me of when a kid plays a bad soccer match and the parent tells them it was not good enough and then asks why the kid is sad and angry. In some sense it should almost be the opposite. The parent should be happy in some sense that the kid is sad and angry because then it means they took what you said seriously and will probably try harder next time (unless the parent has driven them into despair\u2026 hint hint nudge nudge). If the kid was just happy it would be like the kid did not care. This is the point. Our purpose in life is to try and fail and pick ourselves up again until we succeed. And since life is so complicated and dynamic, this is a whole life learning curve that ultimately teaches us to be better people. In conclusion, eat drink and be merry but don\u2019t fall into despair and do not jeopardize your future while in pain. Unfortunately, that is what Cain did. After a poor sacrifice, Cain\u2019s life was not over. But after he killed Abel, god removed him from his plan and kicked him out the land. Find that balance. But ultimately this is a story asking us to pick ourselves up again and again even when life gets hard. I promise you, if God did not see anymore potential in you he would not let you live. While you are alive, God sees potential in you. (This is not the reason all people die).","title":"Love Paradox"},{"location":"loveparadox/#love-paradox","text":"Two blogs ago we talked on the meaning of life and how Genesis one and two flow together to bring out our purpose.

I still love how people wear Hakuna Matata shirts when one of the main points of the Lion King was to show that that is not the point of life. It is like they did not see the whole movie. In any case, in the movie Simba is faced with the option, either he continues though life living like there are no worries or he must fulfill his purpose and try take down Scar. Now, I want to emphasize here that this is where the movie can sometimes miss reality by over exaggerating the success rate. How many times have we metaphorically tried to take down Scar and failed. How many times are you willing to try take down Scar before you just decide my Hakuna Matata life was more fun. The crazy part is that either way Timone and Pumba would have accepted Simba. He was not sinning by not taking down Scar but Rafiki (the monkey) did not look favorably on him. It is interesting how we can see two sides of God in Rafiki in that he accepted Simba but also did not look favorably on him. Here is another thought though. How long could Simba have live in Hakuna Matata world until the lack of purpose in his life would have driven him to despair. Well in Cain\u2019s case, not very long. And he even tried to take down Scar. This is the crux. We live in a world where we are trying to find purpose. We cannot find it solely in creating (job and money and power). We are also cannot find it solely in relationships (family friends and community). However, the second is more important at the end of the day. But sometimes we are not able to fulfill that purpose exactly right. This is why the loss of a job, or a broken relationship or rejection is so hurtful. It is why the first impulse we have when this happens is to get a rebound, drink alcohol, eat comfort food and binge Netflix. This is what Nihilism is. It is complete rejection of purpose. You will find that most people who end up shooting up campuses or something similar are people who have been so hurt by the world due to failure to sacrifice effectively enough such that they end up blaming the world and decide that the only solution is to get revenge on the world by causing as much chaos as possible. Starting to sound even more like Cain? The crazy part of the story of Cain and Abel is that after Cain kills Abel, God still shows some love to Cain as he says anyone who kills Cain will suffer vengeance seven times over. What a crazy statement. Why would God care about what happens to Cain? Well, the point of the story comes right here. God Accepts us and loves us regardless of how successful we are but God will use successful people differently. Furthermore, there is absolutely punishment for sin but there is also forgiveness and second chances. The encouragement from God is keep trying but you actually need to put some effort in. You need to try your best. This leaves one issue left to resolve. How do we handle the situations of rejection and failure. How do we handle that pain? The answer I believe is partly answered in Ecclesiastes. There is this weird refrain in the book saying eat drink and be merry. The idea is that, life is hard and does have all these terrible things that may not even be our fault. Therefore, we should eat drink and be merry. But not at the expense of purpose. There is a balance between Hakuna Matata and fulfilling our purpose Another part of it is just a common theme in the bible. When we love people we take a risk. We do not know how it is going to work out. But taking that risk is more important than not. Otherwise, we could never have anything. When God created us he took the risk that we would not choose him. Therefore, we need to risk in the world. We need to love in this world. Yes, it hurts so much much when we face rejection or it fails. But this is where our purpose lies. Either we try to attain our purpose or we spiral into despair. Fundamentally, this life comes down to a simple analogy. How many times can you pick your self up after you fail to try again and achieve your purpose. If we view life in this perspective perhaps we can see failure in a different perspective. In the movie Meet the Robinsons, the family celebrates his success when he fails. Why, because they know the potentiality behind someone who tries. They realize that becoming a Goob or a Cain is the result of not trying. So perhaps our purpose in life has an added layer. Perhaps, our purpose is not just to achieve success in creating and relationships. Perhaps, our purpose has to do with trying to attain that. But when we do not do it well there are consequences and it hurts but at the end of the day is worth celebrating to some degree. And God seems to agree with that to some degree. He asks Cain why he is downcast and why he is angry. It is like God um come on seriously? You just told him he did not do a good job with his sacrifice. It reminds me of when a kid plays a bad soccer match and the parent tells them it was not good enough and then asks why the kid is sad and angry. In some sense it should almost be the opposite. The parent should be happy in some sense that the kid is sad and angry because then it means they took what you said seriously and will probably try harder next time (unless the parent has driven them into despair\u2026 hint hint nudge nudge). If the kid was just happy it would be like the kid did not care. This is the point. Our purpose in life is to try and fail and pick ourselves up again until we succeed. And since life is so complicated and dynamic, this is a whole life learning curve that ultimately teaches us to be better people. In conclusion, eat drink and be merry but don\u2019t fall into despair and do not jeopardize your future while in pain. Unfortunately, that is what Cain did. After a poor sacrifice, Cain\u2019s life was not over. But after he killed Abel, god removed him from his plan and kicked him out the land. Find that balance. But ultimately this is a story asking us to pick ourselves up again and again even when life gets hard. I promise you, if God did not see anymore potential in you he would not let you live. While you are alive, God sees potential in you. (This is not the reason all people die).","title":"Love Paradox"},{"location":"truth/","text":"What is Truth: Fundamentals to Christianity Truth is a topic that many debate in our current age. Many are happy to uphold a historical, scientific or Mathematics concept of truth that holds for all times and places in the correct sense. But when it comes to theological, moral or philosophical truth, for some reason this idea seems to be no longer relevant. For example, we are happy to state that gravity exists throughout the world regardless of whether you believe it is there or not. We are happy to state that 7+12=19. We are happy to state that 9/11 happened in 2001. We state these as matters of truth. Anyone who does not believe in these things we (at least in our mind) think they are just simply incorrect. If these questions were asked in a test at school, if you said gravity does not exist, 7+12 =14 or 9/11 did not happen you would be marked incorrect and no one would bat an eye. This is important. If these answers could have been marked either correct or incorrect then we have an issue because we would not be able to trust anything. Imagine going through life and receiving an income and not knowing how much that will add to your saving/checking account. Imagine going through life not knowing whether gravity will work or not and potentially just start floating. Imagine going through life not knowing whether what you remember happened yesterday (or in the past in general) actually happened. Life simply would not work. It would be complete chaos. Therefore, truth in its simplest definition is what brings order to chaos. Truth allows us to know that things on this earth are reliable and trustworthy. This brings us to the current post modern dilemma. If truth is necessary for us to make sense of how we live in this world based on history, science and mathematics, what about theology, morality and philosophy. Is it possible to have two contradicting moral codes true at the same time? The answer to this has to be no, however, there is a nuance to it that we will talk about later. If this is the case, then how do you determine whether someone is guilty or not. To put it blankly, if person A thinks murder is a good thing while person B thinks murder is wrong, how do you determine if person B is guilty if they kill someone. Do we just say its okay to murder so that we do not infringe on person B\u2019s beliefs and say well if person A does not want to murder then just do not, its not like they are forced to murder? This clearly does not work and we know that inherently but perhaps we need to look at the fundamental reason behind it. Person A and person B have a completely different view of what gives each person the right to life. Person B is essentially saying that they get to subjectively decide whether someone deserves to live or not. If they do not want someone in this world, they have the right to end to end their life. On the other hand, person A is saying, I cannot be the one to decide whether someone deserves to live or not. There needs to be someone or something objective that can determine this for us. This way we eliminate bias. (You might think this is an outrageous example but I ask you to think about abortion reread the example). Bias and subjectivity go hand in hand. There are many ways the world has attempted to address the issue of bias. One way is the social contract. If most of the population agrees on a particular issue, then it is decided that we have eliminated bias and now can make a more objective decision as to what is morally correct. We also see this in the court room in which they have multiple randomly selected jurors (at least in America). However, we come to an issue with the social contract in that people are limited in knowledge. People throughout history have made terrible moral decisions. Think about the number of people that followed Hitler in Germany or the number of people that wanted slavery in the US or the number of people who voted for the national party in South Africa to continue implementing Apartheid (segregation). Many of these people did not think of themselves as evil or even doing something evil, yet they were clearly facilitating and supporting some very evil regimes. Furthermore, if we go back in time, almost everybody believed that the earth was the center of the universe and that everything rotated around it. This we now know is clearly wrong. If we can make scientific mistakes in the past, what is it to say that we can not make moral mistakes now. Yes, we are evolving as a people and our understanding of truth, but that does not change the fact that something is true. 1000 years ago, the earth was still rotating around the sun and not the center of the universe. 1000 years ago, slavery was wrong. 1000 years ago racism was still wrong. This is all true whether we are in India, England, Serbia, Ghana, in a boat, on a mountain, etc. Even though people did not believe that does not change those facts. This is truth. The simple reality of truth is that when we follow it, order comes to this world. We eliminate chaos. Evil and suffering is a result of chaos. Therefore, if we know that truth exists and it does not depend on time or place, and we know that we are as a people are slowly discovering it as time goes on, then there has to be something outside of us that defines truth. If it were us, we would have found it. But since we are evolving towards truth and discovering it as we go along, who or what set the standard that we are trying to attain? If the answer is the universe, I ask you how something comprised of only matter and forces determined morality. One might say the universe made a certain morality conducive to optimal living, but that implies that the universe has a motive and is more than just matter and forces. Either way we get to a God that is no longer defined by science. This post is not going to go into why I think it is the God of the bible that is true (another post) but for now all statements will Assume that it is the Christian God that is true. The bible starts with a story that says almost exactly what we have been talking about. In Genesis firstly, we see God bring order to chaos in Genesis one then in Genesis two we are introduced to two trees. One is the tree of life and the other is the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God forbids us from eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. But why? what is so bad about this tree. Why is it not just the tree of evil or the tree of death? The serpent then comes along and says that eating from the tree will make us like God which God also affirms in Genesis three. Why is this a problem? You see the issue here is God has defined how the universe works. He created it and brought order or truth to it. But when we decide to take the place of God and decide what good and evil is, we are biased. We have limited knowledge and experience. We have preferences. Ice cream is good. This makes it so easy for us to treat morality like a preference or like an ice cream. Is it not crazy that the cardinal original sin that man committed was deciding by ourselves what is good and evil. Yet, right now we live in a world that encourages exactly that. We have treated truth like it is a preference. But truth is objective. It does not matter whether you like gravity or not, it exists and you have to deal with it. Your opinion of it does not matter. It is the same with morality. To think that we get to decide morality is to commit the cardinal original sin and is playing God. Therefore, quite simply if God says something is true, then guess what\u2026 it is true. We should follow it. Because he designed the universe, what he says is true is what will bring the universe out of the chaos that we plunged it back into in Genesis three. Now here is where it gets interesting. What is it that the bible actually says is true regarding morality. There are 613 laws in the Old Testament. Is that what we are supposed to follow? Here is what I propose. In the new testament Jesus tells us that the two most important commandments are to Love God and love others and that these two commandments fulfill all the laws. I will explain this in greater depth in a later post, but essentially in the Old Testament God was giving us all these laws to teach us what love looks like and how to live it out. But everything can be summed up with love. Therefore, the only truth for morality that God gives us is love. It is about determining what the loving thing to do in each unique situation this chaotic world brings up. But before you commit the cardinal sin again and decide that what you are doing is loving, the challenge would be to read and study the bible and the examples it gives to learn why some things are loving and why some things are not. On top of that, we can use empirical evidence, logic and science to help us determine what is loving as well. But it gets more complicated than this. There are some things that are clearly grey. Alcohol is one of these topics. Dating is another. The question becomes how much alcohol is good. Living a drunken life is wrong but what about in-between. Dating as well. how should that look? These are complicated topics but Paul dresses this in a couple of places one of them being Romans 14. What at face value seems like a weird chapter promoting post modernism is actually the issue of grey that perhaps post modernism was trying to address but went too far. The idea is that for some people it is perfectly permissible to drink alcohol. They do not struggle with any sort of addiction to it and do not look to it for comfort and escapism but rather do it socially in moderation to improve relationships. Others however, may have been alcoholics in the past and any alcohol could trigger them into a bad downhill slide. The point is that people who drink alcohol have no right to force the sober people to drink but at the same time the sober people have no right in telling the alcohol drinkers that they are sinful and bad people. This should be really easy for a post modern to understand but many who are completely against post modernism forget that there are still some instances where it is grey and subjective per person. Oh but how many of us are there that are alcohol drinkers that should be sober? This can be an analogy applied to all different types of grey area issues. What is the objective loving thing to do? As Paul says that we should not let our christian freedom be used as an opportunity for the flesh but through love serve one another. (Galatians 5:13) There we have it. God designed the universe. He designed theology, morality, philosophy, science, math, etc. These things all are designed as components of truth that are designed to bring order to chaos. When we go against them we create chaos which creates chaos and suffering. These things do not change by time or place only in sense. I.e it will always be true to love but that can look different in different circumstances. As we go through this world we will discover what is true. God gave us a big head start with morality but culture changes and it is our job to continually adapt and figure out how to love best in different cultures. We will also continue to discover truth in all the other components. But discovering does not mean it was created but rather it was foundational from the beginning.","title":"What is Truth: Fundamentals to Christianity"},{"location":"truth/#what-is-truth-fundamentals-to-christianity","text":"Truth is a topic that many debate in our current age.
