                <h2 id="psychology-christianity-and-the-bible">Psychology, Christianity and the Bible</h2>
<p>The bible is the groundbreaking truth before all truths on how to live. Since truth presumes love, the bible in essence is love in words. Love is the very thing the reaches for the ultimate good within society and for the world over all future generations. Love is also not a state or goal but a mode of the epitome of being. Psychology is the study of the human mind and how it produces behavior. It does not take much to see that the connection psychology and love, although not congruent as love is more encompassing, is obvious. The goal of this essay is to show how the bible reveals its love and truth in the psychological realm. We will start off by going thorugh the major struggles within life and how the bible helps us to work through them. Then we will work through how the bible encourages us to grow and the psycholgical links there. Then we will start to theorise the ideal of the indivual and finish up with the ideal of society.</p>
<p>Some of the most popular mental health issues in people are acceptance vs rejection, self-worth, depression, anxiety, loneliness, addiction, destroyed reputation and bullying. Many of these are linked of entertwined and so we will deal with the core basis of these and then show how part of the solution is growth which leads into the next section. But to start off, we see that there are a couple of core aspects to the christian message. These are your sins are forgiven and you are loved and adopted and part of God's family. Many christians think that you have to accept God into your heart before your sins are forgiven and you are part of God's family. But I believe this is the wrong way around. The grounds of salvation actually begin when you realize that your sins are forgiven and you are part of God's family. Now why is this distinction important? Firstly, recognizing that your sins are forgiven is salvation out of guilt and shame. Many people are trapped in their own guilt where they are not able to forgive themselves for what they have done. This is why satan means accuser because the ultimate damnation is to live in the guilt of your own sin. This is why the ultimate triumph over satan is the forgiveness of sins. Now, the bible makes it very clear that we are each indivually prominent perpetrators and sinful from the core. The bible further emphsizes this idea that we cannot save ourselves but are rather saved by grace. This is a further fascinating addition to the idea of having our sins forgiven as it emphsizes that the ultimate goal of God (for lack of a better word) is the love which points to redemption and Aquinas' beatific vision. This means that our sins being forgiven is a path to a better world. However, it takes the humility of recoginizing the sin within us and understanding the damage we can do. Therefore, we live by the spirit which is love. So to make this slightly simpler, God forgave us as a recognition that redemption and exoneration will result in a greater world. The salvation aspect of this is the literal belief in the fact that our sins are forgiven and that despite the huge encouragement not to sin (as that prevents growth but more on that later), we are able to be free of guilt. This is the first step remedy to many of the mental health illnesses listed above.</p>
<p>The second part of the statement: we are part of God's family is just as imprtant to believe as being forgiven only solves part of the problem. One may believe their sins are forgiven but without adoption into the family of God there is no true redemption. One of the greatest issues resulting in mental health problems is being rejected. Which is why God accepts us regardless. We see our sins are forgiven so we do not have to worry about there being any barrier between us and God so that we can be fully accepted. One of the quickest ways to cause mental health issues for kids is for their parents to suggest that they are not good enough of fail to show they are accepted and loved. Anything that a kid cannot confess to their parent is a barrier between the parent and kid. This means that the kid is not fully accepted and not fully loved. There is a gap in vulnerability which prevents the relationship from becoming total. This may not be possible in some human relationships from parent to kid and less so between to spouses but with God it can be total if we have the humility to confess everything. We have a connection here between the idea that first we can be fully accepted by God which is again something that we have full access to but need the humility to confess. The result then goes if we confess our sins God will forgive our sins (because we need to recognize our sin and admit that the guit is putting barriers between us and God) and this will enable us to be fully accepted (sound similar to a famous bible verse?). This is a huge step in resolving most mental illnesses particularly addiction.</p>
<p>Now that we have confessed our sins in humility and vulnerability, and have recognized our forgiven sins such that we are living guilt free and in a close relationship with God, we can start to see how these outworkings can help us grow. The first recognition we need to have is that since we are forgiven, then so is everyone else. That means we cannot hold any grudge against anyone because that is attempting to force someone else to live in guilt. But when we go against the hopeful order of God we end up hurting ourself more than them. This is because we have put a barrier between us and that person. This is problematic because that would be a definition of sin. If you think about it, sin is anything that puts a barrier between two or more poeple. When we sin against someone, we do not want to be around them because they hurt us. Now sometimes, it may not be obvious at the time of the sin for example negligence in a toxic relationship, but when everything is figured out and brought to truth, there is a clear barrier between the two people. This means that not forgiving is a sin. It is also a way not to confess sin, which makes it such that it cannot be forgiven not because God is damning but because for their to be salvation within that part of your life it needs to be confessed. This is why we get the bible verse that says something like God will forgive you if you forgive others. Very similar arguments can be made for confessing your sins to others as well as thanking and even praising others. Confessing is obvious but thanking and praising are more complicated. The simple idea however, follows that if we fail to thank someone for doing something nice for us or fail to praise them for doing something great, we have fail to show appreciation for what they have done and attempt to place them below us as if there is some competition or heirarchy between us from a morality perspective. The result is simply that we have put a barrier between us in the relationship. It is not difficult to see how not doing these things can be an attempt to objectify the other person. This is a similar issue that happened in the garden of eden. This also shows that the seemingly insane statement that we often here in church stating that it is right to give him thanks and praise is not so insane but is also part of the confession of sins.</p>
<p>This leads us to a recognition of how relationships should look between us fellow humans -- a relationship not characterized by competition and power but by love. Every way we treat other people should be in line with how we treat God and often is an outflowing of how your relationship with god looks. Hence, the greatest two commandments are love God with everything you have and love others as you love yourself. We love God through being thankful for who we are, for recognizing we are not perfect and have sinned and that he has saved us. We also praise him and join his family. This process leads to us loving ourself as we now are not living by guilt and are fully accepted by God. This now eneables us to see how we should treat others and enable us to love others. These three things are completely connected and rely on each other. If there is a lack of love in how we view God, we cannot love ourself properly and we cannot love others properly. One might object and say well how does someone who does not believe in God live a seemingly normal life? How do they love people? Well the simple solution to this is that the way people live often resembles something similar to belief in God. God is such a complicated idea and so encompassing and is impossible to understand fully which simply results in an inability for us to love perfectly. God is made up of all that is good but also all that is unknown as well as the actualilty behind everything. Because there will alsways be things that we individually and collectively do not know, our love will always be incomplete. This meshed with our selfish and impulsive desires results in sin continuing to exist. Many religions teach people to forgive themselves and forgive others and many psychologists teach this too. Many parents accept and love their kids and many times in marriages people love and accept each other. Often friendships also have this sort of natural result. These psychological acts in which we use a close friend as a representative in how we love God (this is not idolatry but rather living out the love of God practically) can result in people having their own level of salvation. But unless people are able to believe that there is something outside of the world that defines goodness, love and truth, and that this thing/being is working towards ultimate redemption, there will be an obvious incomplete love. Often outside of religious circles, it is okay to put up barriers with people that they do not like (these are not barriers of protection and precaution which are often necessary but are rather barriers of sin caused by unforgiveness, unrepentance, objectification or moral competition within the relationship). Having said that, I know many christians who do the same thing especially when it comes to some level of moral pride in which they hold others in moral contempt. </p>
<p>One main aspect of love is the unity of two or more people for the creation of something greater than the separation of the individuals. However, this unity can only be loving unity if there is mutual respect between the two. Respect is anti-violation. Any violation or abuse between the two parties puts up barriers which prevents a loving relationship. I wrote another blog post on love and respect. (Remember their are two types of barriers, their are sinful barriers which prevent a loving relationship and there are protection barriers which protect us from being hurt both physcially and emoitonally by people). But an additional aspect of love is growing as an individual. There is a reason 25 year olds typically are not freinds with 9 years. If you have a 9 year old maturity and have lived 25 years, you will struggle to find friends. Some people are often more fun and interesting to spend time with. Even if you are a kind person who does not hurt anyone, you may still not be popular or have friends. It may make it harder for you to find a girlfriend/boyfriend. The list of issues may go on but the backbone still remians that we need to live with full respect of others. Often fulfillment within relatinoships depend on growth within ourselves. In general, men and women who do not take care of themselves and live in chaos and do not have a house, car and job will struggle to find a wife or husband. When we are born we have interests and skills that we tend to be better at than other things. One of the main objectives is to work relly hard at those skills and interests to such that you can get a job and start to produce in this world. In general, the goal is to produce more than you consume. Often however, getting a job is not just about being good at one thing but also requires at least a decent level of communication skills. These go together in helping us mature as they help us to be a greater help to society and are able to communicate our love.</p>
